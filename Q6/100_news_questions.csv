As for international demand, it rose 12.4 per cent compared to January 2024, with the capacity rising 8.7 per cent y-o-y and the load factor was 82.6 per cent (+2.7 ppt), also a record high for January.

Meanwhile, IATA said the domestic demand increased 6.1 per cent compared to January 2024, while capacity was up 4.5 per cent y-o-y and the load factor was 81.2 per cent (+1.2 ppt), another record for January.

IATA noted that Asia-Pacific carriers recorded a 21.8 per cent y-o-y increase in demand.

""Capacity grew 16.5 per cent y-o-y, and the load factor reached 86.7 per cent (+3.8 ppt), driven by strong traffic from Northeast Asia,” it said.

IATA’s director general Willie Walsh highlighted that record-high load factors accompanying this strong demand were yet another reminder of the persistent supply chain issues in the aerospace sector.

""The strong demand aligns with our latest November 2024 passenger survey, where 94 per cent of travellers indicated plans to travel as much or more in the next 12 months than they did in the past year.

""Airlines are doing a good job of accommodating growing demand amid fleet and infrastructure constraints with satisfaction levels above 95 per cent, and nearly 80 per cent of travellers agreeing that air travel is good value for money,” he said.

He also noted that some 70 per cent prefer to pay the lowest fare and customise the additional services they need.

1567500,Fire that gutted building in less than an hour kills 8 in the Philippines,"MANILA: A fire gutted a three-story residential building early Thursday (Feb 27) in less than an hour in the Philippines' capital region, killing eight people, officials said.

The blaze, which also injured at least one resident, broke out after midnight in the building, which was mostly made of wood, as people slept in San Isidro Galas village in suburban Quezon city, officials said.

An investigation was underway to determine the cause of the fire.

Two of the dead were found on the ground floor and the bodies of six others were recovered on the second floor, where the fire apparently started, senior fire officer Rolando Valena told The Associated Press, citing witnesses.

Beverly Salvador, 33, said that she, her husband and two children scrambled to escape from their third-floor room by crawling out of a small window in their bathroom as the flames and thick suffocating smoke spread quickly through the lower floors in a near-death experience. They landed on the roof of a neighbouring house.

""I opened our door and saw that the corridor and the stairway going down were already in flames, so I asked my husband to find another way out,” Salvador told the AP. She added that she wept after learning that two families, which were longtime friends, all perished on the second floor.

The blaze happened just two days before the Philippines marks fire-prevention month in March, when the government launches an annual campaign to raise awareness about fire hazards before the onset of the scorching summer season.

Many deadly fires in the Philippines have been blamed on poor enforcement of safety regulations, overcrowding and faulty building designs.

Deputy Transport Minister Manaporn Charoensri explained that the Royal Galaxy Cruise, operated by Happy International Trade, was responsible for dumping waste into the river, causing significant environmental harm.

The Marine Department's director-general has been instructed to investigate the case and immediately suspend the boat's operating licence, she said.

Additionally, the department has been ordered to file a lawsuit against the cruise's crew members under the Navigation in Thai Waters Act, BE 2456 (1913), for allegedly discarding garbage into the river.

Violators could face up to six months in prison and/or a fine of up to 10,000 baht (US$294), she noted.

The Marine Department has also been tasked with coordinating with relevant agencies to strengthen enforcement against violators and promote cooperation in preserving the Chao Phraya River's marine ecosystem.

Meanwhile, Marine Department director-general Kritphet Chaichuai said officials have been ordered to gather evidence for legal action against the crew at Pakkhlongsan Police Station and conduct an inspection of the diner cruise.

Initially, the department will suspend the boat's operating licence, he said, adding that discussions will be held with the Thai Boats Association and passenger boat operators on measures to protect the river’s ecosystem.

1567474,Cautious sentiment weakens ringgit against US dollar,"KUALA LUMPUR: Cautious market sentiment and a lack of local catalysts have led the ringgit to trade easier against the US dollar at the opening today.

At 8 am, the ringgit weakened to 4.4530 from 4.4410/4480 at yesterday’s close.

Bank Muamalat Malaysia Bhd chief economist Dr Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid said traders and investors are cautious ahead of the release in the United States (US) Personal Consumption Expenditures inflation data tonight, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge.

""On that note, ringgit could stay weak today, with US dollar-ringgit pair likely hovering around its immediate resistant level of RM4.45,” he told Bernama.

Despite Malaysia's strong economic fundamentals, he pointed out that the lack of local catalysts has influenced demand for the ringgit.

""Foreign fund flows in equities remain negative this month. From Feb 3 to 26, net outflows stood at RM1.5 billion, while in January, there were RM3 billion in net sales.

""For the past five consecutive months, foreign investors have been net sellers in our equities market, although the bond market’s performance has been slightly better. This is a systemic risk rather than a reflection of fundamentals, as our economy remains strong,” he added.

Citing a report on foreign outflow in the regional markets, he noted that in February, India recorded a net outflow of US$2.72 million, Indonesia (US$452.1 million), South Korea (US$605.6 million), and Taiwan (US$110.4 million ).

Meanwhile, the ringgit was traded mostly higher against major currencies.

It was higher against the British pound to 5.6090/6317 from 5.6303/6392, and improved against the euro to 4.6284/6472 from 4.6559/6633, but easier against the Japanese yen at 2.9657/9779 from 2.9634/9683.

Inter-Pacific Research said the key index may seek near-term stability to end the week on a steadier note, though President Trump’s confirmation of import tariffs on neighbouring countries and China could keep market players cautious.

It noted that with the financial reporting season nearing its end, market players will turn to other developments for trading opportunities.

“Even so, we think that further gains may become more difficult to attain as many market players will still be on a wait-and-see stance, and the key index could instead look to build up a base around 1,580-1,600 levels for the time being.

“There is support at the 1,580-1,583 levels, with the ensuing support pegged at the 1,575 level. The resistances, meanwhile, are at 1,590 and 1,595 points,” Inter-Pacific said.

1567331,Seoul: North Korean reinforcements sent to Russia,"The South’s spy agency said that North Korea appears to have sent additional troops to Russia, after its soldiers deployed on the Russian-Ukraine fronts suffered heavy casualties.

The National Intelligence Service said in a brief statement on Wednesday it was trying to determine exactly how many more troops North Korea has deployed to Russia.

The NIS also assessed that North Korean troops were redeployed at fronts in Russia’s Kursk region in the first week of February, following a reported temporary withdrawal from the area.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in an address on Feb 7, confirmed a new Ukrainian offensive in Kursk and said North Korean troops were fighting alongside Russian forces there.

North Korea has been supplying a vast amount of conventional weapons to Russia, and last fall it sent about 10,000-12,000 troops to Russia as well, according to US, South Korean and Ukraine intelligence officials.

North Korean soldiers are highly disciplined and well trained, but observers say they’ve become easy targets for drone and artillery attacks on Russian-Ukraine battlefields due to their lack of combat experience and unfamiliarity with the terrain.

In January, the NIS said about 300 North Korean soldiers had died and another 2,700 had been injured. Zelenskyy earlier put the number of killed or wounded North Koreans at 4,000, though US estimates were lower at around 1,200.

Earlier Wednesday, South Korea’s JoongAng Ilbo newspaper, citing unidentified sources, reported that an additional 1,000-3,000 North Korean soldiers were deployed to Kursk between January and February.

South Korea, the US and their partners worry that Russia could reward North Korea by transferring high-tech weapons technologies that can sharply enhance its nuclear weapons programme.

1567336,Coexistence poses a jumbo-sized conundrum,"The island nation vowed to urgently tackle costly clashes between villagers and wild elephants after reporting the deaths of nearly 1,200 people and over 3,500 animals in a decade.

Environment Minister Dam­mika Patabendi said that they will build more electrified fences and deploy additional staff to help reduce elephant raids on villages near wildlife sanctuaries.

“We are allocating more money to reduce the human-elephant conflict, and are hopeful that within a short period of time we will be able to mitigate the situation,” Patabendi said yesterday.

Between 2015 and 2024, 1,195 people and 3,484 wild elephants were killed, he said.

In January this year, three more people and 43 elephants were killed.

Opposition legislator Nalin Bandara said the toll was “shocking” and urged authorities to protect people, while also ensuring that the wild animals were not harmed.

He noted that disposing of the carcasses of wild elephants had cost the state about US$11.6mil (RM51.3mil) over a decade, while compensation to victims of elephant attacks was about US$4mil (RM17.6mil) over that period.

Killing or harming elephants is a criminal offence in Sri Lanka, which has an estimated 7,000 wild elephants, which are considered a national treasure, partly due to their significance in Buddhist culture.

However, the massacre continues as desperate farmers struggle with elephants raiding their crops and destroying livelihoods.

Many elephants have been electro­cuted, shot and poisoned. Sometimes explosives-packed fruits are used to injure the animals, often ending in painful deaths.

Elephants are also killed by trains running through their habitats.

Seven elephants, including four calves, were killed when they were run over by an express train in the island’s eastern Habarana region a week ago. It was the worst such accident recorded in the country.

Asian elephants are recognised as endangered by the Inter­national Union for Conservation of Nature.

1567330,Journo jailed over Facebook posts,"A local court sentenced a lea­ding independent journalist to 30 months in prison over Facebook posts that criticised the government, state media said.

Huy Duc (pic) worked for influential state-run newspapers before authoring one of Vietnam’s most popular blogs and Facebook accounts, where he criticised the country’s communist leaders on issues such as corruption, media control and relations with China.

The court in Hanoi yesterday convicted the 63-year-old of “abusing democratic freedoms to infringe upon the interests of the state” through posting 13 articles on Facebook, according to Vietnam News Agency (VNA).

Huy Duc said he did not intend to oppose the Communist Party or the state, but admitted some content violated its interests, for which he took responsibility and was “very sorry”, VNA reported.

The trial lasted just a few hours.

“These articles have a large number of interactions, comments, and shares, causing negative impacts on social order and safety,” the indictment read, according to state media.

Shortly before his arrest last June, Huy Duc – the journalist’s pen name – took aim online at Vietnam’s most powerful leader To Lam, as well as his predecessor Nguyen Phu Trong.

It was unclear whether the charges related to those particular posts.

Vietnam, a one-party state, has no free media and clamps down hard on any dissent. It is one of the world’s top jai­lers of journalists, according to the Reporters Without Borders (RSF) press freedom campaign group.

Huy Duc, whose real name is Truong Huy San, is a former senior army lieutenant.

He was fired from a state news outlet in 2009 for criticising past actions by Vietnam’s former communist ally, the Soviet Union.

Huy Duc spent a year at Harvard University on a Nieman Fellowship in 2012.

During his time abroad, his account of life in Vietnam after the end of the war with the United States, “The Winning Side”, was published.

RSF said previously that his articles were “an invaluable source of information enabling the Vietnamese public to access censored information by the Hanoi regime”.

1567335,Devotees mark Shivaratri with prayers,"Millions of devotees across India celebrated the Shivaratri festival that honours the Hindu god Shiva, one of the main deities of Hinduism.

The devotees celebrated the festival in temples by pouring water or milk over the Shiva linga, a stone sculpture symbolic of Shiva, the Hindu god of destruction.

Some also observed a fast during the day and stayed up all night, singing and dancing to religious songs.

At some temples, Hindu holy men, also known as Sadhus, smoked marijuana – a practice that is normally illegal but is permitted during the Shivaratri festival – and smeared their bodies with ash in devotion.

The festival was also celebrated in neighbouring Nepal’s Pashupati temple, and many Indian Hindus, who make up 80% of the country’s 1.4 billion people, travelled there for the festival.

This year’s festival coincided with the last day of the Maha Kumbh festival that’s held every 12 years.

This year, the festival started on Jan 13, with more than 500 million people attending so far.

At least 30 people were killed in a stampede at the festival last month, after tens of millions of Hindus gathered to take a dip in sacred river waters.

The latest trip indicates North Korea may be gearing up for a full resumption of its international tourism to bring in much-needed foreign currency to revive its struggling economy, experts say.

The Beijing-based travel company Koryo Tours said it arranged a five-day trip from Feb 20 to Feb 24 for 13 international tourists to the northeastern North Korean border city of Rason, where the country’s special economic zone is located.

Koryo Tours general manager Simon Cockerell said the travellers from the United Kingdom, Canada, Greece, New Zealand, France, Germany, Austria, Australia and Italy crossed by land from China.

He said that in Rason, they visited factories, shops, schools and the statues of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il, the late grandfather and father of current leader Kim Jong-un.

“Our first tour has been and gone, and now more tourists on both group and private visits are going in, arranging trips.”

After the pandemic began, North Korea quickly banned tourists, jetted out diplomats and severely curtailed border traffic in one of the world’s most draconian Covid-19 restrictions.

KNM said in a filing with Bursa Malaysia that its wholly owned subsidiary KNM Process Systems Sdn Bhd (KNMPS) had entered into a conditional sale, purchase and transfer agreement with NGK to dispose of its 100% equity interest in Deutsche KNM GmbH (DKNM), the investment holding company for Borsig.

This is part of KNM’s efforts to regularise its financial position as a Practice Note 17 company and pare down its RM1.27bil debt. The sale proceeds would be used to settle borrowings, reducing its total debt to RM69.42mil and improving its gearing ratio from 3.94 times to 0.22 times.

KNM chairman Tunku Datuk Yaacob Khyra described the disposal as a strategic decision that aligned with the company’s restructuring plan.

“By reducing our debt burden, we are positioning ourselves for future expansion and strategic investments,” he said in a statement.

The DKNM Group contributed 80.82% and 83.08% of KNM Group’s revenue for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2023 (FY23) and the nine-month financial period ended Sept 30, 2024 (9M24), respectively.

KNM said that while listing Borsig was preferred, the deal with NGK offered a valuation comparable to an initial public offering while providing immediate liquidity.

Following the disposal, KNM will focus on growing its Malaysian operations through KNMPS, which designs and manufactures process equipment for the oil and gas, petrochemical, and fertiliser industries.

The 39-year-old was detained in Bangkok on Wednesday following a joint operation with Singaporean authorities, Thai police said on Thursday.

The suspect, identified by police as Chia, is accused of hacking into dozens of companies, stealing sensitive data and selling it on the dark web, officials said.

His arrest followed an extortion complaint from a Thai company which reported receiving threats via the X account ""@0mid16b"", demanding payment in exchange for withholding stolen customer data.

Edi Susianto, Bank Indonesia's head of monetary management, told Reuters the rupiah depreciation was due to US President Donald Trump's trade policies.

We will boldly enter the market to maintain the balance of foreign-exchange supply and demand so that market confidence is maintained,"" Edi Susianto, executive director for monetary management at Bank Indonesia, said in a text message.

Authorities also intervened on Thursday, as reported by Bloomberg.

Asian currencies face multiple headwinds including growing pressure from US President Donald Trump's trade policies and uncertainty over the Federal Reserve's easing cycle. In Indonesia, weak economic growth is adding to risks with stocks on track for the fifth straight month of net foreign outflows.

The rupiah ""looks likely to continue trading with a more risk-off tone,"" said Alan Lau, a strategist at Malayan Banking Bhd in Singapore. ""The situation though still looks fluid as it is uncertain if the tariff threats could just represent mere brinkmanship or if it would materialize.""

According to the Palawan Police Provincial Office, the fishermen were fishing about 26 miles off Calandagan near Canaron Island, using hook and line, when they caught a 20-kilogramme shark.

Upon returning to shore, the fishermen slaughtered the shark to sell it to waiting residents. During the process, a human arm measuring approximately 30 cm (12 inches) fell out of the shark’s stomach.

The fishermen immediately buried the severed arm and reported the incident to authorities.

On Feb 17, personnel from the Araceli Municipal Police Station and the Municipal Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office went to the barangay to retrieve the arm for fingerprinting and possible identification. However, the arm was too decomposed to obtain fingerprints.

Meanwhile, the Sangguniang Barangay of Calandagan released an official statement explaining that they did not publicly disclose the incident to avoid confusion and to allow authorities to handle the situation appropriately.

Barangay officials also said they investigated and interviewed the fishermen involved and subsequently turned the matter over to higher authorities for further examination. - Philippine Daily Inquirer/ANN",Politics,2025-02-28,206,What did the fishermen from Barangay Calandagan in Araceli town find inside the shark they caught?

“We have routine [patrols] every day, but we will increase our supervision even further during Ramadan,” Banda Aceh Satpol PP WH head Muhammad Rizal said on Thursday (Feb 27) in the Acehnese capital, as quoted by kompas.com.

The agency had mapped out priority regions for the intensified patrol, such as the subdistricts of Peunayong and Kampung Baru, he added, and that rules specific to the holy fasting month included an opening time of 9:30 p.m. for coffee shops and cafes.

“We will make sure that no establishments are open during ishak [evening prayer] and tarawih [Ramadan evening prayers],” Rizal said. Hotels will be the main focus of patrol personnel, while the agency will run a concurrent public campaign on education and awareness to encourage compliance with shariah.

The airline reported strong demand across its budget and full-service operations.

The flag carrier’s shares soared as much as 8% to A$9.60, marking their biggest intraday gain since Oct 13, 2022. The stock was among the biggest gainers in the ASX 200 benchmark, which traded 0.6% higher as at 0047 GMT.

It declared an interim dividend of 16.5 Australian cents per share, the first payout since it paid 13 cents in September 2019.

“Our financial strength means we are now in a position to pay our shareholders dividends for the first time in almost six years,” Qantas chief executive officer Vanessa Hudson said.

The group added 11 new and five used aircraft in the six months to December, and yesterday announced cabin upgrades for 42 Boeing 737 aircraft to align them with incoming new aircraft cabins.

1567422,Migrant arrests at US-Mexico border near record low in February,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The number of migrants caught illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in February is on pace to be at or near a record monthly low, a U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson and two other sources told Reuters.

U.S. Border Patrol is on pace to have arrested around 8,500 migrants at the border in February as the end of the month nears, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said. Two other sources said the monthly total would be at or near a record low.

President Donald Trump, a Republican, took an array of actions to deter illegal immigration after returning to the White House on January 20, saying a crackdown was needed after high levels of migration under his predecessor, former President Joe Biden.

Trump's moves included implementing a sweeping ban on asylum at the border and surging military troops to assist border security.

The American Civil Liberties Union sued the Trump administration over the ban earlier this month, arguing it violated U.S. asylum law and international treaties.

The Trump administration also struck new agreements with Mexico and Central American countries to accept U.S. deportees from other nations and has sent some migrants to a camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

U.S. Border Patrol's monthly enforcement statistics go back to 2000. The lowest monthly total on record is currently April 2017, when the agency arrested 11,127 at the start of Trump's first term.

While the number of border arrests similarly dipped at the start of Trump's 2017-2021 presidency - what some called ""the Trump effect"" - they rebounded in some months and years that followed.

The February projection would be a steep drop from the 141,000 migrant arrests in February 2024 and down from 29,000 in January, according to U.S. government figures.

1567456,US securities regulator files to dismiss lawsuit against Coinbase,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday filed to dismiss its lawsuit against Coinbase, the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, putting an end to a legal battle as the regulator moves to change course under President Donald Trump.

The SEC sued Coinbase in 2023, alleging the exchange flouted the agency's rules and facilitated trading in at least 13 crypto tokens that it said should have been registered as securities.

Coinbase had said last week that the SEC planned to withdraw the case.

Coinbase argued that crypto assets, unlike stocks and bonds, do not meet the definition of an investment contract, a position held by the vast majority of the crypto industry. As outlined in a U.S. Supreme Court case, a key test for whether an investment product is a security is whether people are investing in a common enterprise with the expectation of profit.

The lawsuit also targeted Coinbase's ""staking"" program, in which it pools assets to verify activity on blockchain networks and takes commissions, in exchange for ""rewards"" to customers. The SEC said that program should have been registered with the agency.

The SEC also sued rival trading platform Binance in 2023. A court has separately paused the agency's lawsuit against Binance after a joint request, citing implications of the SEC's new crypto task force, which was established shortly after Trump took office last month.

Republican officials at the SEC immediately began to overhaul the agency's crypto policies, even before the arrival of Paul Atkins, Trump's crypto-friendly pick for SEC chair.

Revisiting cases against crypto firms - especially those which violated the SEC's rules but were not alleged to have defrauded investors - has been broadly anticipated. Many legal experts, however, told Reuters they expected the SEC to seek settlements and any mass effort to dismiss all pending matters would be seen as unprecedented.

MPS president Shahman Jalaludin told StarMetro that the council would deploy more of its personnel to keep an eye on bazaars in the Selangor municipality throughout the Ramadan period.

He also said traders who were given permits were selected after taking into consideration various criteria.

“This includes the applicant being a Malaysian and has received the typhoid vaccination.

“Traders must have also attended the council’s Ramadan bazaar briefing session,” he said after chairing MPS’ full board meeting.

He said the briefing session was held on Feb 19 at Dewan Beringin in Taman Sri Gombak.

Traders were briefed about hygiene, food safety, enforcement of regulations and solid waste management.

Shahman hoped that the briefing could help traders understand guidelines set by MPS to ensure order, cleanliness and safety at Ramadan bazaars.

This year, MPS prepared 1,970 lots across 31 locations for Ramadan bazaar traders.

Previously, there had been reports that some Ramadan lots in Kuala Lumpur were being resold for huge profits.

Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim had warned that Ramadan bazaar licences found to have been resold would be revoked immediately.

Selangor youth, sports and entrepreneurship committee chairman Mohd Najwan Halimi had also reminded licensed traders to follow regulations and refrain from transferring their permits to third parties, as this could lead to legal repercussions.

On a separate matter, Shahman said the first assessment tax term this year ends today, and a late charge of RM20 would be imposed on those who fail to pay on time.

“The charge will be imposed from March 1 to March 31.

“Seizure warrants will be issued to those who still fail to pay starting April 1,” he said.

He added that as of Jan 31, MPS had collected RM20.79mil in assessment tax.

They are also unhappy about several non-functional parking payment machines there, which is causing great inconvenience.

Nadila Abd Rahim said that because of this, visitors tended to crowd at the remaining few machines still functional.

“The machines are also located far from each other, forcing us to walk some distance to pay for parking,” she said.

KC Chong, meanwhile, took issue with poor lighting at the underground facility, which she said posed a risk especially to women.

“Some parts of the carpark are very dark, which may encourage criminals to take advantage of the situation,” she said.

Lenovo sued Ericsson at London's High Court in 2023, one of several cases brought by Lenovo or Ericsson around the world which has seen the companies trade lawsuits in Brazil, Colombia and the United States.

The dispute centres on the fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms for a licence to use Lenovo and Ericsson's patents. Disputes over FRAND licensing have led to global legal battles in the telecom industry.

In London, Lenovo sought a declaration that a willing licensor would agree to a short-term licence pending the final determination of FRAND terms.

Its application was refused last year, but the Court of Appeal overturned that decision on Friday.

Judge Richard Arnold said in a written ruling that ""a willing licensor in the position of Ericsson would enter into an interim licence with Lenovo"", adding that he hoped Ericsson would now choose to do so.

Lenovo's Chief Legal Officer Laura Quatela said the ruling ""not only confirms that Lenovo is a willing licensee but strengthens and reaffirms our commitment to advocating for transparency and fairness in global FRAND licensing"".

A civil suit filed Feb 26 argues that two nature-based projects Apple cites to back claims of carbon neutrality are areas where trees would be growing regardless of whether the tech company was involved.

""Apple's carbon neutrality claims are false and misleading because both projects fail to provide genuine, additional carbon reductions,"" the suit contends.

Apple, however, rejects the claims, telling AFP Thursday the company had ""drastically cut emissions for Apple Watch by over 75%, and we are investing significantly in nature-based projects to remove hundreds of thousands of metric tons of carbon from the air.""

The US tech giant claims to have retired 485,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents primarily through the Chyulu Hills Project in Kenya and the Guinan Project in China, according to the suit.

The Chyulu Hills Project purports to generate carbon credits by preventing deforestation but is on land that has been legally protected from deforestation since 1983, the suit maintains.

The Guinan Project claims to have planted trees on barren land but the area was already heavily forested before the project began, according to the suit.

Plaintiffs in the case are asking for class-action status to represent everyone who has bought the Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch Ultra 2, or the second-generation Apple Watch SE.

Two Singaporean men, 41 and 49, were charged for criminal conspiracy to commit fraud on a supplier of servers by making a false representation, according to the charge sheets. A Chinese national, 51, was charged for committing a fraud.

The case comes weeks after Bloomberg News reported that the US was investigating whether Chinese artificial intelligence sensation DeepSeek had circumvented US chip sanctions with help of third parties in Singapore. Local media including the broadcaster CNA reported that the arrests were linked to the shipment of Nvidia chips to China.

The police didn’t provide details on the nature of the fraud or the products potentially involved, nor did they name the server computer supplier involved. The Chinese man was charged for making a false representation that a company named Luxuriate Your Life Pte ""would be the end user of the items,” according to his charge sheet.

Such offenses carry a prison sentence of up to 20 years in jail, the police said in a separate statement. In total, the police are investigating 22 individuals and companies for suspected involvement in fraud by false representation.

Singapore, which has close trade relations with both the US and China, has been caught in the middle of a tech war between the two superpowers.

The initiative aims to enhance communication, education and public awareness, particularly in areas related to waste management and environmental sustainability, said SWM Environment’s General Manager (Corporate), Mohd Norlisam Mohd Nordin.

He said that the MoU places significant importance on knowledge-sharing regarding sustainable waste management.

""This includes fostering a culture of waste separation at the source to facilitate recycling efforts,"" he said after the signing of the MoU on Friday (Feb 28).

The MoU was signed in a ceremony at UiTM Melaka Campus here, with SWM Environment represented by Mohd Norlisam and UiTM by its Rector, Prof Datuk Ts Dr Mohd Rasdi Zaini.

1567453,Duolingo forecasts annual revenue above estimates on strong adoption of AI features,"(Reuters) -Language learning app Duolingo forecast annual revenue above Wall Street expectations on Thursday, anticipating a stronger adoption of its subscription tier featuring artificial intelligence capabilities.

The Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based company's shares were up about 4% in extended trading.

The company operates a ""freemium"" model, providing a basic set of features for all users at no cost with additional capabilities available through monthly or annual paid subscriptions.

Duolingo runs two subscription tiers — Super for avid users, and Max, which includes a generative AI-driven feature that simulates natural conversations through video calls.

Over the past few months, Duolingo has expanded the feature to a slew of languages to rake in more subscribers and grow revenue, but the video call feature on its Max subscription added to costs.

It expects revenue for 2025 to be in the range of $962.5 million to $978.5 million, compared to analysts' estimate of $965.9 million, according to data compiled by LSEG.

Duolingo forecast revenue for the first quarter ranging from $220.5 million to $223.5 million. Analysts, on average, were expecting $221.1 million.

""There's a marginal cost to Max, and that marginal cost is we call generative AI models to power what is the most important part of Max, which is the video call, and that did have about a 100-basis-point impact to gross margin,"" Chief Financial Officer Matt Skaruppa told Reuters.

""The first priority is innovating as quickly as possible, experimenting as quickly as possible to drive more engagement, and then the costs will come down over time.""

The firm also forecast adjusted core profit between $259.9 million and $274 million this year, below estimates of $272.1 million, largely due to costs related to its AI video call features.

The company said chatter around the TikTok ban in January and a marketing campaign in which the app's mascot, Duo, faked his death and returned led to a jump in users in February.

The group said it had filed complaints with watchdogs in Norway, Germany and Spain after collecting evidence that Facebook's parent company had not listened to explicit user requests to opt out of data collection and targeted advertisements.

A Meta spokesperson said the company was unaware of the details of the Eko complaints and could not respond, but that it is committed to protecting users' data privacy.

In light of Europe's data protection rules, the U.S. tech giant introduced ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram in Europe that require a paid subscription, and people who agree to be tracked - most users - get a free service funded by ad revenues. Europe's Data Protection Board (EDPB) questioned that policy in 2024 but has not taken action.

""EU data protection regulators must pull Meta into line,"" spokesperson Eoin Dubsky said. He said 5,000 members of the group, which seeks to defend consumer rights against corporations, had asked Meta to stop processing their personal data. With the users' permission, Eko then observed as the company continued to serve them targeted ads.

Dubsky said Eko's goal is to trigger an investigation or action from the watchdogs.

A spokesperson for Norway's data protection authority confirmed it had received complaints from Eko members and that it has relayed them to the Irish Data Protection Commission, the lead supervisory authority for Meta in Europe.

""However, speaking on a general level, the right to object is a key right for individuals, as invasive tracking and monitoring for advertising purposes may violate their fundamental rights,"" Tobias Judin said, adding that Norway would remain involved in the case.

The alternative asset manager has discussed providing a major part of the financing, according to the report.

Growing computational requirements of artificial intelligence systems have significantly increased the demand for data centers.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg had said in January the company would spend as much as $65 billion this year to expand its AI infrastructure.

Meta also plans to invest $10 billion to set up an AI data center in Louisiana, it said in December.

The amount of electricity used by the Meta data center in Louisiana will be matched by renewable energy, for which the tech firm will be working with utility Entergy.

Last week, brokerage TD Cowen said Microsoft canceled leases totaling ""a couple of hundred megawatts"" of capacity with at least two private data-center operators.

It has stoked skepticism among investors due to slow payoffs and breakthroughs at Chinese startup DeepSeek, which showcased AI tech at a much lower cost than its Western rivals.

The move undermines state institutions, touching off a constitutional crisis in ethnically polarised post-war Bosnia. Russia, Dodik's most powerful supporter, said the sentence was politically motivated and would destabilise the Balkans.

The court in Bosnia's capital Sarajevo acted after Dodik

signed Serb Republic legislation suspending rulings by Bosnia's constitutional court and international envoy Christian Schmidt, who oversees implementation of the 1995 Dayton peace treaty.

Dodik, in remarks to lawmakers before they approved the law on Thursday evening, cast the move as an act of secession in defiance of the 1990s peace accord that kept Bosnia intact but split into two autonomous regions largely along ceasefire lines.
