“The public should also familiarise themselves with the key steps in providing immediate help before professional assistance arrives.

“The first step is to ensure the scene is safe for yourself and the victim before starting the rescue.

“If the victim is non-responsive, ask someone to call 999 for an ambulance, and retrieve an AED device if one is available nearby.

“The next step is to open the victim’s airway using the ‘head tilt-chin lift’ technique.

“At the same time check for breathing and observe if the chest rises, for signs of life,” he said.

Steven said if the person was not breathing, chest compressions should be performed immediately at a rate of 100 to 120 compressions per minute.

“An AED should be attached as soon as possible to analyse the heart’s rhythm and, if necessary, deliver a shock to restore it to normal rhythm.

“It is important to avoid touching the patient while the AED analyses or delivers a shock,” he said.

The director of AED solutions provider MyAED4U has been actively conducting CPR and AED training at various events.

Steven recently conducted a fire safety, CPR and AED awareness programme at a community hall in Bukit Dumbar, Penang.

The event, organised by Bukit Dumbar Village Community Management Council (MPKK), highlighted the importance of acquiring life-saving skills.

Bukit Dumbar MPKK chairman Yeoh Chin Beng said an AED unit was purchased and installed in the neighbourhood, thanks to generous contributions from residents and a local temple.

Penang social development, welfare and non-Islamic religious affairs committee chairman Lim Siew Khim praised Bukit Dumbar MPKK for organising the programme.

She also contributed 100 small fire extinguishers to bolster safety measures in the neighbourhood.","THE Sibu branch of Malaysian Red Crescent Society (MRCS) has been urged to provide public training on the use of Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs).

Bukit Assek assemblyman Joseph Chieng said this would ensure life-saving interventions are both accessible and effective when needed.

Chieng said this in response to Deputy Premier Datuk Dr Sim Kui Hian’s proposal to amend Sarawak Building Ordinance 1994, making AEDs mandatory in some locations.

“Given Sarawak’s high prevalence of heart disease, I fully support this proposal and believe MRCS Sibu can play a crucial role in its implementation,” Chieng said during the society’s appreciation dinner.

He added that it was not enough just to have AEDs and regulations.

“If no one knows how to use the equipment, its presence cannot save lives.

“This is why Sibu branch must take the lead in providing AED training to local communities.”

Separately, Chieng said the branch faced challenges in recruiting members and volunteers.

He said sustaining financial stability was also a pressing issue as the organisation depended on public support and sponsorships to continue its work.

“Raising awareness about the importance of humanitarian efforts requires consistent engagement and education of the community,” he added.

Chieng commended members, volunteers and staff of the Sibu branch for their dedication and tireless service.

“From disaster response and health campaigns to first-aid training and humanitarian outreach, your contributions reflect the core values of the Red Crescent movement: humanity, impartiality and voluntary service.

“These values remind us of the importance of coming together as a community to support one another, especially in challenging times,” Chieng added.

Branch chairman Penghulu Chua Hiong Kee expressed gratitude to smart partnership collaborators, school teachers, fellow Red Crescent members and volunteers for their service.","KOTA BARU: A 12-year-old boy drowned while swimming in the Sungai Tok Bali lagoon, Jalan Semerak, Pasir Putih near here on Friday (Feb 28).

Manchester City face the prospect of a second hiding this week, following their exit from the Champions League, orchestrated by Real Madrid.

Guardiola has conceded more than once in recent weeks that they are in a dark place and are finding it difficult to emerge from.

This is in stark contrast to the club’s fortunes that saw them bask in glory as they won four league titles in a row last season, and dominated the English game for the best part of a decade and a half.

Arsenal's makeshift attack struggled to make any impact in their shock 1-0 home loss to West Ham United on Saturday and they were held to a goalless draw at third-placed Nottingham Forest on Wednesday.

Arteta said that even if Saka and Martinelli return for Arsenal's first match after the international break the pair would need to be closely monitored.

""After that, they've been out for a long, long time, so we're going to have to integrate them as well gradually. They are evolving well but they're still a bit far.

""The Verizon communication system to air traffic control is breaking down very rapidly. The FAA assessment is single digit months to catastrophic failure, putting air traveler safety at serious risk,"" Musk, said in a post on social media platform X.

This week, the FAA said it was testing three Starlink terminals at a government facility in Alaska to address concerns about reliable weather information for the aviation community in that state.

""The FAA has been considering the use of Starlink since the prior administration to increase reliability at remote sites, including in Alaska,"" the FAA said this week. The agency did not immediately comment on Musk's tweet.

Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's government had previously said it was considering the use of Musk's Starlink satellites to provide encrypted communications between officials operating in risky areas.

The suggestion was sharply criticised by opposition politicians, who questioned the wisdom of handing a national security contract to a foreign entrepreneur who is also part of the U.S. government under President Donald Trump.

Urso did not give a timing for the development of the project and did not specify which companies the government had called in, but said the national space agency would carry out a feasibility study.

Musk has a warm relationship with Meloni and said last month he would be ready to offer his services to Italy. However, Defence Minister Guido Crosetto denied an agreement had been sealed.

Lai, a restaurant worker in Ipoh, is expected to undergo surgery next month.

Foundation chief executive officer Yvonne Yee said the campaign, featured on Feb 20 in The Star, touched hearts and drew generous contributions from readers nationwide.

The selected recipients were trying their best to support their families despite financial hardship, exemplifying resilience in the face of adversity.

The recipients were single mum Tham Yoke Yen, 43, single father to three girls Loo Choo Wong, 61, who makes ends meet as a part-time masseur, and supermarket promoter Lai Ai Tai, 45, who cares for her husband undergoing kidney dialysis treatments.

The others were rubber tapper Chin Sun Yin, 68, tile factory assistant Wong Kah Sin, 48, and 55-year-old Hong Mei Choon, who looks after her husband who suffered a stroke.

IJM Land Bhd chief operating officer Datuk Chai Kian Soon said the annual tradition of giving back reaffirms the developer’s commitment to community welfare and reflects the true spirit of togetherness and renewal during the festive season.

“At IJM Seremban 2, we are honoured to extend our support to these underprivileged families, providing them with the optimism and courage they need during these challenging times.

“Our goal is to ease their burden and bring joy to their festive celebrations,” he said.

The charity festive programme aimed to help such families navigate their challenges with renewed hope and a sense of community as they welcome the Lunar New Year.

Immigration director-general Datuk Zakaria Shaaban said the raids were conducted at upscale condominiums, where the centres were located, at around 11.30am on Wednesday.

“Those detained were 14 male Chinese nationals, 15 men and four women from Indonesia, a man and two women from Myanmar, two Bangladeshi men, two women from Laos and six Thai women.

“Those detained are aged between 23 and 54,” he said.

Various items were seized including four laptops, 88 mobile phones, 26 SIM cards and RM100,000 cash, he said.

“We carried out intelligence for three weeks before raiding the residential units.

“The scammers were renting the units,” he added.

Zakaria said the scammers would dupe victims by “selling” stock shares, gold and property online.

“They used social media and chat applications such as Facebook, TikTok, WhatsApp and Telegram to lure victims.

“They not only targeted locals but also foreigners from their respective home countries.

“We believe they also operated bogus online gambling,” he said.

Zakaria added that the suspects would send offers for the items directly to the victims’ mobile phones at random.

“When the victims show interest, they were required to transfer funds to an account given by the syndicate.

“The victims realised they had been duped when the seller could not be reached after the money was transferred,” he said.

“Each syndicate member is paid between RM2,500 and RM3,500 monthly.”

He also reminded the public not to harbour undocumented foreigners as it is a serious offence."
