The latest trip indicates North Korea may be gearing up for a full resumption of its international tourism to bring in much-needed foreign currency to revive its struggling economy, experts say.

The Beijing-based travel company Koryo Tours said it arranged a five-day trip from Feb 20 to Feb 24 for 13 international tourists to the northeastern North Korean border city of Rason, where the country’s special economic zone is located.

Koryo Tours general manager Simon Cockerell said the travellers from the United Kingdom, Canada, Greece, New Zealand, France, Germany, Austria, Australia and Italy crossed by land from China.

He said that in Rason, they visited factories, shops, schools and the statues of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il, the late grandfather and father of current leader Kim Jong-un.

“Since January of 2020, the country has been closed to all tourists, and we are glad to have finally found an opening in the Rason area, in the far north of North Korea,” Cockerell said.

“Our first tour has been and gone, and now more tourists on both group and private visits are going in, arranging trips.”

After the pandemic began, North Korea quickly banned tourists, jetted out diplomats and severely curtailed border traffic in one of the world’s most draconian Covid-19 restrictions.

But since 2022, North Korea has been slowly easing curbs and reopening its borders.

He said this decision was reached during the Asean Tourism Ministers Meeting, which took place on Wednesday (Jan 19) in Johor,

Tiong said the change aims to accurately represent inbound and outbound travellers across member nations.

He said that countries like Thailand and Malaysia experience significant cross-border movement, and unified terminology would improve data collection and policy formulation.

In response to concerns raised by opposition MP Mas Ermieyati (PN-Masjid Tanah) about the adequacy of surveys, Tiong confirmed that comprehensive surveys have been carried out at various entry points, including airports.

""We have conducted surveys at airports to monitor the number of visitors from China, Arab countries, Singapore, and others. These are not arbitrary figures,"" he said while winding up his ministerial reply on the motion of thanks for the Royal Address on Wednesday (Feb 20).

Meanwhile, Tiong also addressed the progress of the Visit Malaysia 2026 (VM2026) promotional video.

He attributed the delays to pending submissions from various states concerning their respective tourist attractions.

""Some states have yet to provide information on their tourism products, which is why our officials need to visit these locations personally,"" he explained.

The promotional video for VM2026, which is approximately 30 minutes long, was set to launch on Feb 26. It would showcase Malaysia's tourism offerings, divided into five zones encompassing all states.

The latest rate is far below the half of Americans with passports, a level that has soared from around five per cent in 1990.

As of December 2024, there were 21.6 million valid Japanese passports in circulation, representing around 17.5 per cent of the overall population, the foreign ministry said on Thursday (Feb 20).

Before the Covid-19 pandemic, about a quarter of Japanese people owned valid passports.

The country's travel document is tied with neighbour South Korea's passport as the world's second strongest after Singapore, allowing visa-free entry to 190 destinations, according to this year's Henley Passport Index.

Outbound travel from Japan has gradually resumed after the quarantine measures and border closures of the pandemic era, according to the ministry.

But the weakness of the yen -- which has shed a third of its value in the past five years -- is one factor deterring Japanese travellers along with inflation and a renewed interest in domestic travel, analysts say.

The new data comes as the nation welcomes a record influx of tourists from other countries, with more than 36 million visits recorded last year and many flocking to hotspots like Kyoto.

International travel by Japanese nationals began to increase sharply in the boom years of the late 1980s.

In 1990, more than 10 million people from Japan travelled abroad, a figure that rose to 20 million before the pandemic.

This year around 14.1 million Japanese are expected to travel abroad, according to top Japanese travel agency JTB.

""In recent years, the rapid depreciation of the yen has caused some to refrain from overseas travel, but once the currency market calms, overseas travel is expected to pick up steam,"" said its study, issued in January. - AFP"

Kim's trip to the Kang Kon Military Academy comes after North Korea has sent thousands of troops to Russia to support its war against Ukraine. This week Kim also visited the Kim Il Sung University of Politics, another elite cadre training institution, calling for military loyalty and sacrifice.

South Korea's intelligence agency has said Kim's previous inspections of military units and training might be part of preparations for an additional dispatch of soldiers to Russia.

During the latest visit to the military academy, Kim criticised the school's poor management and operation of educational facilities, saying it failed to meet the ruling party's pursuit of ""modernity and advanced character"" in building a powerful army, KCNA said.

He laid out tasks to refurbish the facilities and intensify education focusing on practice so that the students would learn about the ""actual experiences of modern warfare"", and to master advanced weapons and technical equipment, it said.

""The present international situation, in which the aggressive and bellicose nature of the imperialists is most openly expressed in history and war and bloodshed become commonplaces, requires the armed forces ... to perfectly cope with a war,"" Kim said, according to KCNA. South Korean officials have warned that North Korea could benefit from supplying weapons and troops to fight in Russia by gaining experience and insight from operating on a modern battlefield.

Kyiv has said North Korean forces have suffered heavy casualties in Russia, with more than 3,000 soldiers killed or wounded by early January this year.

The state works, transportation, infrastructure and communications committee chairman said road users should also be offered park-and-ride options outside of the central business district before such a policy could be implemented.

“For now Johor Baru is not ready for this, as we have yet to have a comprehensive public transport masterplan.

“Since the reopening of the borders (that Malaysia shares with Singapore), roads have been congested,” he told reporters after inspecting a road upgrading project in Kempas here on Thursday (Feb 27).

Mohamad Fazli was referring to the Causeway and Second Link, which were closed on March 17, 2020 due to Covid-19. The travel restrictions were lifted on April 1, 2022.

He added that congestion charges may not solve the existing traffic problem unless road users have options such as rebates for taking the bus instead of driving.

He was responding to Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Federal Territories) Dr Zaliha Mustafa, who earlier told the Dewan Rakyat that cities like George Town in Penang, Kuala Lumpur and Johor Baru were identified for the initial rollout of proposed congestion charges.

She reportedly said the proposed charges are still being studied by the Malaysian Institute of Road Safety Research and the Malaysian Green Technology and Climate Corporation.

The aspects being studied include the implementation mechanism, potential reduction in traffic volume and projected update of public transportation if the congestion charge is introduced.

The minister added that if implemented, the congestion charge, to discourage motorists from using certain roads, could reduce traffic volume in Kuala Lumpur by 20%."

Lembaga Tabung Haji (TH) chief executive officer Syed Hamadah Syed Othman advised pilgrims to schedule an appointment through the MySejahtera application from Feb 14 or via TH’s official website.

""A day before the vaccination date, an appointment reminder will be sent via MySejahtera to ensure pilgrims do not miss their vaccination session,” he said.

Syed Hamadah said pilgrims who were not in the mandatory category but wanted additional protection could opt for voluntary vaccination after consulting a medical officer at designated health facilities.

""Pilgrims seeking extra protection are highly encouraged to take the pneumococcal vaccine, which can be administered together with the influenza vaccine, as pneumococcal disease is a leading cause of hospitalisation among them,” he said.

On Feb 15, the Health Ministry announced that all prospective haj pilgrims were required to receive the meningococcal vaccine, while Covid-19 and influenza vaccines were mandatory for targeted groups.

Covid-19 is not just a common cold, as it can lead to serious complications, particularly among the elderly and those with chronic illnesses such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, asthma, and chronic lung conditions.

The side effects of the vaccine are generally mild and temporary, including slight pain at the injection site, fatigue, or a mild fever.

However, those with chronic illnesses such as diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, asthma, or chronic lung disease are at higher risk of severe Covid-19, which may require hospital treatment.

With the introduction of digital vaccination certificates, prospective pilgrims no longer need to bring physical vaccination books or cards when travelling to the Holy Land.

All vaccination certificates can be downloaded via the MySejahtera application and presented to the Saudi Arabian authorities when required.

But for Joshua, 29, a recent Green Day concert in Malaysia was more than just a night of music.

It was a chance to reconnect with his father, James, 58, through a shared passion that had shaped their lives for decades.

For Joshua, this was not a spur-of-the-moment idea. Music had always been their common language.

Growing up, his father filled car rides with the sounds of Blink-182, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Muse, and, of course, Green Day.

""He also loved playing Boney M and Bob Marley. We’d listen to radio together every time he drove me to school, tuition or organ classes,"" Joshua told Sinar Daily.

James, now retired, has an unwavering love for music. His hobby room is packed with CDs and cassettes, a nostalgic tribute to his punk rock roots.

""My dad’s favourite Green Day songs are Good Riddance (Time of Your Life) and Wake Me Up When September Ends. Mine are American Idiot and Boulevard Of Broken Dreams,"" he shared.

The concert, according to the duo, was an unforgettable experience.

""It was one of the best concerts I’ve ever attended. The energy was incredible, and they played all our favourite songs. Both of us had the time of our lives,” Joshua said.

This wasn’t their first musical outing together. Last year, Joshua treated his father to an Arijit Singh concert as a retirement gift.

""People always ask if it is awkward to go to a concert with dad,"" he laughs. ""But not with a man who’s lived for punk rock music! He’s the reason I love music today,"" he said.

The concert wasn’t just about the music—it was a heartfelt reminder of how art can bridge generations.

Kim's trip to the Kang Kon Military Academy comes after North Korea has sent thousands of troops to Russia to support its war against Ukraine. This week Kim also visited the Kim Il Sung University of Politics, another elite cadre training institution, calling for military loyalty and sacrifice.

South Korea's intelligence agency has said Kim's previous inspections of military units and training might be part of preparations for an additional dispatch of soldiers to Russia.

During the latest visit to the military academy, Kim criticised the school's poor management and operation of educational facilities, saying it failed to meet the ruling party's pursuit of ""modernity and advanced character"" in building a powerful army, KCNA said.

He laid out tasks to refurbish the facilities and intensify education focusing on practice so that the students would learn about the ""actual experiences of modern warfare"", and to master advanced weapons and technical equipment, it said.

""The present international situation, in which the aggressive and bellicose nature of the imperialists is most openly expressed in history and war and bloodshed become commonplaces, requires the armed forces ... to perfectly cope with a war,"" Kim said, according to KCNA. South Korean officials have warned that North Korea could benefit from supplying weapons and troops to fight in Russia by gaining experience and insight from operating on a modern battlefield.

Kyiv has said North Korean forces have suffered heavy casualties in Russia, with more than 3,000 soldiers killed or wounded by early January this year.

(Reporting by Hyonhee Shin; Editing by Ed Davies and Lincoln Feast.)","The South’s spy agency said that North Korea appears to have sent additional troops to Russia, after its soldiers deployed on the Russian-Ukraine fronts suffered heavy casualties.

The National Intelligence Service said in a brief statement on Wednesday it was trying to determine exactly how many more troops North Korea has deployed to Russia.

The NIS also assessed that North Korean troops were redeployed at fronts in Russia’s Kursk region in the first week of February, following a reported temporary withdrawal from the area.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in an address on Feb 7, confirmed a new Ukrainian offensive in Kursk and said North Korean troops were fighting alongside Russian forces there.

North Korea has been supplying a vast amount of conventional weapons to Russia, and last fall it sent about 10,000-12,000 troops to Russia as well, according to US, South Korean and Ukraine intelligence officials.

North Korean soldiers are highly disciplined and well trained, but observers say they’ve become easy targets for drone and artillery attacks on Russian-Ukraine battlefields due to their lack of combat experience and unfamiliarity with the terrain.

In January, the NIS said about 300 North Korean soldiers had died and another 2,700 had been injured. Zelenskyy earlier put the number of killed or wounded North Koreans at 4,000, though US estimates were lower at around 1,200.

Earlier Wednesday, South Korea’s JoongAng Ilbo newspaper, citing unidentified sources, reported that an additional 1,000-3,000 North Korean soldiers were deployed to Kursk between January and February.

South Korea, the US and their partners worry that Russia could reward North Korea by transferring high-tech weapons technologies that can sharply enhance its nuclear weapons programme.

North Korea is expected to receive economic and other assistance from Russia as well.

During talks in Saudi Arabia last week, Russia and the US agreed to start working towards ending the war and improving their diplomatic and economic ties. Ukrainian officials weren’t present at the talks. — AP"

The latest rate is far below the half of Americans with passports, a level that has soared from around five per cent in 1990.

As of December 2024, there were 21.6 million valid Japanese passports in circulation, representing around 17.5 per cent of the overall population, the foreign ministry said on Thursday (Feb 20).

Before the Covid-19 pandemic, about a quarter of Japanese people owned valid passports.

The country's travel document is tied with neighbour South Korea's passport as the world's second strongest after Singapore, allowing visa-free entry to 190 destinations, according to this year's Henley Passport Index.

Outbound travel from Japan has gradually resumed after the quarantine measures and border closures of the pandemic era, according to the ministry.

But the weakness of the yen -- which has shed a third of its value in the past five years -- is one factor deterring Japanese travellers along with inflation and a renewed interest in domestic travel, analysts say.

The new data comes as the nation welcomes a record influx of tourists from other countries, with more than 36 million visits recorded last year and many flocking to hotspots like Kyoto.

International travel by Japanese nationals began to increase sharply in the boom years of the late 1980s.

In 1990, more than 10 million people from Japan travelled abroad, a figure that rose to 20 million before the pandemic.

This year around 14.1 million Japanese are expected to travel abroad, according to top Japanese travel agency JTB.

A commentary carried by KCNA said Washington should be wary of consequences for what it said were nuclear alliances, naming AUKUS and the trilateral cooperation with South Korea and Japan.

Australia just made its first $500 million payment to the U.S. under the AUKUS nuclear submarine deal.

Under AUKUS, Australia will pay the United States $3 billion to boost the capacity of the U.S. submarine industry, and Washington will sell several Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarines to Australia in the early 2030s.

It also argued the U.S. sees North Korea as an obstacle to its establishment of hegemony in the region and said nuclear states will not sit idly by, referring to itself.

North Korea has been criticizing the trilateral military cooperation between South Korea, Japan and the U.S. and has called the relationship ""the Asian version of NATO"".

He said that in Rason, they visited factories, shops, schools and the statues of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il, the late grandfather and father of current leader Kim Jong-un.

“Since January of 2020, the country has been closed to all tourists, and we are glad to have finally found an opening in the Rason area, in the far north of North Korea,” Cockerell said.

“Our first tour has been and gone, and now more tourists on both group and private visits are going in, arranging trips.”

After the pandemic began, North Korea quickly banned tourists, jetted out diplomats and severely curtailed border traffic in one of the world’s most draconian Covid-19 restrictions.

The latest rate is far below the half of Americans with passports, a level that has soared from around five per cent in 1990.

As of December 2024, there were 21.6 million valid Japanese passports in circulation, representing around 17.5 per cent of the overall population, the foreign ministry said on Thursday (Feb 20).

Before the Covid-19 pandemic, about a quarter of Japanese people owned valid passports.

The country's travel document is tied with neighbour South Korea's passport as the world's second strongest after Singapore, allowing visa-free entry to 190 destinations, according to this year's Henley Passport Index.

Outbound travel from Japan has gradually resumed after the quarantine measures and border closures of the pandemic era, according to the ministry.

But the weakness of the yen -- which has shed a third of its value in the past five years -- is one factor deterring Japanese travellers along with inflation and a renewed interest in domestic travel, analysts say.

The new data comes as the nation welcomes a record influx of tourists from other countries, with more than 36 million visits recorded last year and many flocking to hotspots like Kyoto.

International travel by Japanese nationals began to increase sharply in the boom years of the late 1980s.

In 1990, more than 10 million people from Japan travelled abroad, a figure that rose to 20 million before the pandemic.

This year around 14.1 million Japanese are expected to travel abroad, according to top Japanese travel agency JTB.

But since 2022, North Korea has been slowly easing curbs and reopening its borders.

He said this decision was reached during the Asean Tourism Ministers Meeting, which took place on Wednesday (Jan 19) in Johor,

Tiong said the change aims to accurately represent inbound and outbound travellers across member nations.

He said that countries like Thailand and Malaysia experience significant cross-border movement, and unified terminology would improve data collection and policy formulation.

In response to concerns raised by opposition MP Mas Ermieyati (PN-Masjid Tanah) about the adequacy of surveys, Tiong confirmed that comprehensive surveys have been carried out at various entry points, including airports.

""We have conducted surveys at airports to monitor the number of visitors from China, Arab countries, Singapore, and others. These are not arbitrary figures,"" he said while winding up his ministerial reply on the motion of thanks for the Royal Address on Wednesday (Feb 20).

Meanwhile, Tiong also addressed the progress of the Visit Malaysia 2026 (VM2026) promotional video.

He attributed the delays to pending submissions from various states concerning their respective tourist attractions.

""Some states have yet to provide information on their tourism products, which is why our officials need to visit these locations personally,"" he explained.

The promotional video for VM2026, which is approximately 30 minutes long, was set to launch on Feb 26. It would showcase Malaysia's tourism offerings, divided into five zones encompassing all states.

The previously released Visit Malaysia 2026 (VM2026) teaser video has drawn criticism for omitting mosques while featuring other religious landmarks like Batu Caves and Christ Church Melaka.

“For 2025, we hope the number of international tourists to Cambodia will increase to between 7.2 million and 7.5 million,” he said.

The latest trip indicates North Korea may be gearing up for a full resumption of its international tourism to bring in much-needed foreign currency to revive its struggling economy, experts say.

The Beijing-based travel company Koryo Tours said it arranged a five-day trip from Feb 20 to Feb 24 for 13 international tourists to the northeastern North Korean border city of Rason, where the country’s special economic zone is located.

Koryo Tours general manager Simon Cockerell said the travellers from the United Kingdom, Canada, Greece, New Zealand, France, Germany, Austria, Australia and Italy crossed by land from China.

He said that in Rason, they visited factories, shops, schools and the statues of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il, the late grandfather and father of current leader Kim Jong-un.

“Since January of 2020, the country has been closed to all tourists, and we are glad to have finally found an opening in the Rason area, in the far north of North Korea,” Cockerell said.
