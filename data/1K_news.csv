1567500,Fire that gutted building in less than an hour kills 8 in the Philippines,"MANILA: A fire gutted a three-story residential building early Thursday (Feb 27) in less than an hour in the Philippines' capital region, killing eight people, officials said.

The blaze, which also injured at least one resident, broke out after midnight in the building, which was mostly made of wood, as people slept in San Isidro Galas village in suburban Quezon city, officials said.

An investigation was underway to determine the cause of the fire.

Two of the dead were found on the ground floor and the bodies of six others were recovered on the second floor, where the fire apparently started, senior fire officer Rolando Valena told The Associated Press, citing witnesses.

Beverly Salvador, 33, said that she, her husband and two children scrambled to escape from their third-floor room by crawling out of a small window in their bathroom as the flames and thick suffocating smoke spread quickly through the lower floors in a near-death experience. They landed on the roof of a neighbouring house.

""I opened our door and saw that the corridor and the stairway going down were already in flames, so I asked my husband to find another way out,” Salvador told the AP. She added that she wept after learning that two families, which were longtime friends, all perished on the second floor.

The blaze happened just two days before the Philippines marks fire-prevention month in March, when the government launches an annual campaign to raise awareness about fire hazards before the onset of the scorching summer season.

Many deadly fires in the Philippines have been blamed on poor enforcement of safety regulations, overcrowding and faulty building designs.

A 1996 disco fire in Quezon city killed 162 people, mostly students celebrating the end of the school year, in one of the deadliest nightclub fires in the world in recent decades. They were unable to escape because the emergency exit was blocked by a new building next door. - AP",Politics,2025-02-28,324
1567480,Thai cruise owner faces licence suspension for dumping garbage in Chao Phraya river,"BANGKOK: The owner of a diner cruise faces a licence suspension for allegedly disposing of garbage into the Chao Phraya River, the Transport Ministry said on Thursday (Feb 27).

Deputy Transport Minister Manaporn Charoensri explained that the Royal Galaxy Cruise, operated by Happy International Trade, was responsible for dumping waste into the river, causing significant environmental harm.

The Marine Department's director-general has been instructed to investigate the case and immediately suspend the boat's operating licence, she said.

Additionally, the department has been ordered to file a lawsuit against the cruise's crew members under the Navigation in Thai Waters Act, BE 2456 (1913), for allegedly discarding garbage into the river.

Violators could face up to six months in prison and/or a fine of up to 10,000 baht (US$294), she noted.

The Marine Department has also been tasked with coordinating with relevant agencies to strengthen enforcement against violators and promote cooperation in preserving the Chao Phraya River's marine ecosystem.

Meanwhile, Marine Department director-general Kritphet Chaichuai said officials have been ordered to gather evidence for legal action against the crew at Pakkhlongsan Police Station and conduct an inspection of the diner cruise.

Initially, the department will suspend the boat's operating licence, he said, adding that discussions will be held with the Thai Boats Association and passenger boat operators on measures to protect the river’s ecosystem.

Anyone who witnesses water safety incidents can call the Marine Department’s hotline 1199 anytime, he added. - The Nation/ANN",Politics,2025-02-28,241
1567474,Cautious sentiment weakens ringgit against US dollar,"KUALA LUMPUR: Cautious market sentiment and a lack of local catalysts have led the ringgit to trade easier against the US dollar at the opening today.

At 8 am, the ringgit weakened to 4.4530 from 4.4410/4480 at yesterday’s close.

Bank Muamalat Malaysia Bhd chief economist Dr Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid said traders and investors are cautious ahead of the release in the United States (US) Personal Consumption Expenditures inflation data tonight, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge.

""On that note, ringgit could stay weak today, with US dollar-ringgit pair likely hovering around its immediate resistant level of RM4.45,” he told Bernama.

Despite Malaysia's strong economic fundamentals, he pointed out that the lack of local catalysts has influenced demand for the ringgit.

""Foreign fund flows in equities remain negative this month. From Feb 3 to 26, net outflows stood at RM1.5 billion, while in January, there were RM3 billion in net sales.

""For the past five consecutive months, foreign investors have been net sellers in our equities market, although the bond market’s performance has been slightly better. This is a systemic risk rather than a reflection of fundamentals, as our economy remains strong,” he added.

Citing a report on foreign outflow in the regional markets, he noted that in February, India recorded a net outflow of US$2.72 million, Indonesia (US$452.1 million), South Korea (US$605.6 million), and Taiwan (US$110.4 million ).

Meanwhile, the ringgit was traded mostly higher against major currencies.

It was higher against the British pound to 5.6090/6317 from 5.6303/6392, and improved against the euro to 4.6284/6472 from 4.6559/6633, but easier against the Japanese yen at 2.9657/9779 from 2.9634/9683.

It slipped against the Philippine peso to 7.69/7.73 from yesterday’s close of 7.67/7.69 and declined against the Indonesian rupiah to 270.5/271.8 from 269.8/270.4. - Bernama",Business,2025-02-28,323

The Nasdaq tumbled 2.78% to 18,544.42 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.45% to 43,239.50 points.

The FBM KLCI fell 5.99 points, or 0.38%, to 1,580.53 at 9.12 am. The index opened 6.56 points lower at 1,580.04 earlier.

Inter-Pacific Research said the key index may seek near-term stability to end the week on a steadier note, though President Trump’s confirmation of import tariffs on neighbouring countries and China could keep market players cautious.

It noted that with the financial reporting season nearing its end, market players will turn to other developments for trading opportunities.

“Even so, we think that further gains may become more difficult to attain as many market players will still be on a wait-and-see stance, and the key index could instead look to build up a base around 1,580-1,600 levels for the time being.

“There is support at the 1,580-1,583 levels, with the ensuing support pegged at the 1,575 level. The resistances, meanwhile, are at 1,590 and 1,595 points,” Inter-Pacific said.

Meanwhile, Rakuten Trade expressed disappointment over the lack of sustainability in recent buying activity, suggesting that the benchmark index may undergo minor consolidation in the near term.

1567331,Seoul: North Korean reinforcements sent to Russia,"The South’s spy agency said that North Korea appears to have sent additional troops to Russia, after its soldiers deployed on the Russian-Ukraine fronts suffered heavy casualties.

The National Intelligence Service said in a brief statement on Wednesday it was trying to determine exactly how many more troops North Korea has deployed to Russia.

The NIS also assessed that North Korean troops were redeployed at fronts in Russia’s Kursk region in the first week of February, following a reported temporary withdrawal from the area.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in an address on Feb 7, confirmed a new Ukrainian offensive in Kursk and said North Korean troops were fighting alongside Russian forces there.

North Korea has been supplying a vast amount of conventional weapons to Russia, and last fall it sent about 10,000-12,000 troops to Russia as well, according to US, South Korean and Ukraine intelligence officials.

North Korean soldiers are highly disciplined and well trained, but observers say they’ve become easy targets for drone and artillery attacks on Russian-Ukraine battlefields due to their lack of combat experience and unfamiliarity with the terrain.

In January, the NIS said about 300 North Korean soldiers had died and another 2,700 had been injured. Zelenskyy earlier put the number of killed or wounded North Koreans at 4,000, though US estimates were lower at around 1,200.

Earlier Wednesday, South Korea’s JoongAng Ilbo newspaper, citing unidentified sources, reported that an additional 1,000-3,000 North Korean soldiers were deployed to Kursk between January and February.

South Korea, the US and their partners worry that Russia could reward North Korea by transferring high-tech weapons technologies that can sharply enhance its nuclear weapons programme.

North Korea is expected to receive economic and other assistance from Russia as well.

During talks in Saudi Arabia last week, Russia and the US agreed to start working towards ending the war and improving their diplomatic and economic ties. Ukrainian officials weren’t present at the talks. — AP",Politics,2025-02-28,323
1567336,Coexistence poses a jumbo-sized conundrum,"The island nation vowed to urgently tackle costly clashes between villagers and wild elephants after reporting the deaths of nearly 1,200 people and over 3,500 animals in a decade.

Environment Minister Dam­mika Patabendi said that they will build more electrified fences and deploy additional staff to help reduce elephant raids on villages near wildlife sanctuaries.

“We are allocating more money to reduce the human-elephant conflict, and are hopeful that within a short period of time we will be able to mitigate the situation,” Patabendi said yesterday.

Between 2015 and 2024, 1,195 people and 3,484 wild elephants were killed, he said.

In January this year, three more people and 43 elephants were killed.

Opposition legislator Nalin Bandara said the toll was “shocking” and urged authorities to protect people, while also ensuring that the wild animals were not harmed.

He noted that disposing of the carcasses of wild elephants had cost the state about US$11.6mil (RM51.3mil) over a decade, while compensation to victims of elephant attacks was about US$4mil (RM17.6mil) over that period.

Killing or harming elephants is a criminal offence in Sri Lanka, which has an estimated 7,000 wild elephants, which are considered a national treasure, partly due to their significance in Buddhist culture.

However, the massacre continues as desperate farmers struggle with elephants raiding their crops and destroying livelihoods.

Many elephants have been electro­cuted, shot and poisoned. Sometimes explosives-packed fruits are used to injure the animals, often ending in painful deaths.

Elephants are also killed by trains running through their habitats.

Seven elephants, including four calves, were killed when they were run over by an express train in the island’s eastern Habarana region a week ago. It was the worst such accident recorded in the country.

Asian elephants are recognised as endangered by the Inter­national Union for Conservation of Nature.

An estimated 26,000 of them live in the wild, mostly in India, surviving for an average of 60-70 years outside captivity. — AFP",Politics,2025-02-28,323
1567330,Journo jailed over Facebook posts,"A local court sentenced a lea­ding independent journalist to 30 months in prison over Facebook posts that criticised the government, state media said.

Huy Duc (pic) worked for influential state-run newspapers before authoring one of Vietnam’s most popular blogs and Facebook accounts, where he criticised the country’s communist leaders on issues such as corruption, media control and relations with China.

The court in Hanoi yesterday convicted the 63-year-old of “abusing democratic freedoms to infringe upon the interests of the state” through posting 13 articles on Facebook, according to Vietnam News Agency (VNA).

Huy Duc said he did not intend to oppose the Communist Party or the state, but admitted some content violated its interests, for which he took responsibility and was “very sorry”, VNA reported.

The trial lasted just a few hours.

“These articles have a large number of interactions, comments, and shares, causing negative impacts on social order and safety,” the indictment read, according to state media.

Shortly before his arrest last June, Huy Duc – the journalist’s pen name – took aim online at Vietnam’s most powerful leader To Lam, as well as his predecessor Nguyen Phu Trong.

It was unclear whether the charges related to those particular posts.

Vietnam, a one-party state, has no free media and clamps down hard on any dissent. It is one of the world’s top jai­lers of journalists, according to the Reporters Without Borders (RSF) press freedom campaign group.

Huy Duc, whose real name is Truong Huy San, is a former senior army lieutenant.

He was fired from a state news outlet in 2009 for criticising past actions by Vietnam’s former communist ally, the Soviet Union.

Huy Duc spent a year at Harvard University on a Nieman Fellowship in 2012.

During his time abroad, his account of life in Vietnam after the end of the war with the United States, “The Winning Side”, was published.

RSF said previously that his articles were “an invaluable source of information enabling the Vietnamese public to access censored information by the Hanoi regime”.

1567335,Devotees mark Shivaratri with prayers,"Millions of devotees across India celebrated the Shivaratri festival that honours the Hindu god Shiva, one of the main deities of Hinduism.

The devotees celebrated the festival in temples by pouring water or milk over the Shiva linga, a stone sculpture symbolic of Shiva, the Hindu god of destruction.

Some also observed a fast during the day and stayed up all night, singing and dancing to religious songs.

At some temples, Hindu holy men, also known as Sadhus, smoked marijuana – a practice that is normally illegal but is permitted during the Shivaratri festival – and smeared their bodies with ash in devotion.

The festival was also celebrated in neighbouring Nepal’s Pashupati temple, and many Indian Hindus, who make up 80% of the country’s 1.4 billion people, travelled there for the festival.

This year’s festival coincided with the last day of the Maha Kumbh festival that’s held every 12 years.

This year, the festival started on Jan 13, with more than 500 million people attending so far.

At least 30 people were killed in a stampede at the festival last month, after tens of millions of Hindus gathered to take a dip in sacred river waters.

Hindus believe that bathing at the confluence of the Ganges, Yamuna and mythical Saraswati rivers in the northern city of Prayagraj during the Maha Kumbh, the water will cleanse them of their sins and release them from the cycle of rebirth. — AP",Politics,2025-02-28,239

The latest trip indicates North Korea may be gearing up for a full resumption of its international tourism to bring in much-needed foreign currency to revive its struggling economy, experts say.

The Beijing-based travel company Koryo Tours said it arranged a five-day trip from Feb 20 to Feb 24 for 13 international tourists to the northeastern North Korean border city of Rason, where the country’s special economic zone is located.

Koryo Tours general manager Simon Cockerell said the travellers from the United Kingdom, Canada, Greece, New Zealand, France, Germany, Austria, Australia and Italy crossed by land from China.

He said that in Rason, they visited factories, shops, schools and the statues of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il, the late grandfather and father of current leader Kim Jong-un.

“Since January of 2020, the country has been closed to all tourists, and we are glad to have finally found an opening in the Rason area, in the far north of North Korea,” Cockerell said.

“Our first tour has been and gone, and now more tourists on both group and private visits are going in, arranging trips.”

After the pandemic began, North Korea quickly banned tourists, jetted out diplomats and severely curtailed border traffic in one of the world’s most draconian Covid-19 restrictions.

But since 2022, North Korea has been slowly easing curbs and reopening its borders.

KNM said in a filing with Bursa Malaysia that its wholly owned subsidiary KNM Process Systems Sdn Bhd (KNMPS) had entered into a conditional sale, purchase and transfer agreement with NGK to dispose of its 100% equity interest in Deutsche KNM GmbH (DKNM), the investment holding company for Borsig.

This is part of KNM’s efforts to regularise its financial position as a Practice Note 17 company and pare down its RM1.27bil debt. The sale proceeds would be used to settle borrowings, reducing its total debt to RM69.42mil and improving its gearing ratio from 3.94 times to 0.22 times.

The 39-year-old was detained in Bangkok on Wednesday following a joint operation with Singaporean authorities, Thai police said on Thursday.

The suspect, identified by police as Chia, is accused of hacking into dozens of companies, stealing sensitive data and selling it on the dark web, officials said.

His arrest followed an extortion complaint from a Thai company which reported receiving threats via the X account ""@0mid16b"", demanding payment in exchange for withholding stolen customer data.

Atip Pongsivapai, commander of Thailand's Technology Crime Suppression Division, said they began tracking the hacker's activities after receiving the complaint.

Chia has confessed to hacking into company databases and selling stolen data, Thai police said.

Since 2020, he has breached more than 70 organisations, including 20 companies in Thailand, according to police.

During the raid, gold ornaments, luxury items and brand-name products worth around $300,000 were seized.

Chia has been charged with extortion, unauthorised access to computer systems, and illegal stay in Thailand, officials said.

Edi Susianto, Bank Indonesia's head of monetary management, told Reuters the rupiah depreciation was due to US President Donald Trump's trade policies.

We will boldly enter the market to maintain the balance of foreign-exchange supply and demand so that market confidence is maintained,"" Edi Susianto, executive director for monetary management at Bank Indonesia, said in a text message.

Authorities also intervened on Thursday, as reported by Bloomberg.

Asian currencies face multiple headwinds including growing pressure from US President Donald Trump's trade policies and uncertainty over the Federal Reserve's easing cycle. In Indonesia, weak economic growth is adding to risks with stocks on track for the fifth straight month of net foreign outflows.

The rupiah ""looks likely to continue trading with a more risk-off tone,"" said Alan Lau, a strategist at Malayan Banking Bhd in Singapore. ""The situation though still looks fluid as it is uncertain if the tariff threats could just represent mere brinkmanship or if it would materialize.""

The rupiah has been under pressure this year after BI cut its benchmark interest rate in January in an unexpected move. The currency has slumped almost 3% this year in the worst performance among major emerging-Asian peers.

Indonesia stocks have also been underperforming, with the Jakarta Composite Index falling by 11% in this year, the worst performer among major Asian indices after Thailand. Global funds have pulled out nearly $1 billion from domestic equities.

“We will make sure that no establishments are open during ishak [evening prayer] and tarawih [Ramadan evening prayers],” Rizal said. Hotels will be the main focus of patrol personnel, while the agency will run a concurrent public campaign on education and awareness to encourage compliance with shariah. The country’s westernmost region of Aceh imposes Islamic law under its designation as a special province.

Ramadan is expected to begin on the evening of March 1 this year, pending confirmation from the government’s moonsighting committee after observing the phase of the moon on Friday.

The country’s second-largest Muslim organisation Muhammadiyah, which uses a different method to determine the first day of the fasting month, announced in mid-January a starting date of March 1.

Meanwhile, the Aceh Food Agency has assured the public that food supplies were stable for Ramadan. Badriah Hasballah, the agency’s food availability and security head, said her office had monitored food stocks and made projections in anticipation of the expected surge in demand during the Ramadan-Aidil Fitri holiday season.

“We’ve prepared food supply projections, not just for Ramadan, but for every month. The goal is to assess demand and supply so we can prepare preventive measures, particularly during major religious holidays,” she said on Monday, as quoted by state-owned radio station RRI. - The Jakarta Post/ANN",Politics,2025-02-28,341
1567275,Qantas splurges on first post Covid dividends,"SYDNEY: Australia’s Qantas Airways has showered investors with its first post-pandemic ordinary dividend, and a special dividend, for the first time in a quarter of a century.

The airline reported strong demand across its budget and full-service operations.

The flag carrier’s shares soared as much as 8% to A$9.60, marking their biggest intraday gain since Oct 13, 2022. The stock was among the biggest gainers in the ASX 200 benchmark, which traded 0.6% higher as at 0047 GMT.

It declared an interim dividend of 16.5 Australian cents per share, the first payout since it paid 13 cents in September 2019.

A special dividend of 9.9 cents apiece was also announced for the first time since fiscal 2000.

“Our financial strength means we are now in a position to pay our shareholders dividends for the first time in almost six years,” Qantas chief executive officer Vanessa Hudson said.

The group added 11 new and five used aircraft in the six months to December, and yesterday announced cabin upgrades for 42 Boeing 737 aircraft to align them with incoming new aircraft cabins.

Qantas expects its first ultra long-haul “Project Sunrise” Airbus A350-1000 jet, designed for non-stop Sydney-London flights, in the second half of 2026.

The carrier reported an 11% year-on-year growth in underlying profit before tax for the six months that ended Dec 31 (1H25), to A$1.39bil (US$875.42mil).

Qantas reported a 6.6% fall in international fares across the group, and a 0.8% rise in domestic fares, noting that the rise was below inflation.

The airline forecast growth of between 3% and 5% in domestic unit revenue in 2H25, compared with 5% growth in 1H25.

It expects international unit revenue to stay flat. — Reuters",Business,2025-02-28,282
1567422,Migrant arrests at US-Mexico border near record low in February,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The number of migrants caught illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in February is on pace to be at or near a record monthly low, a U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson and two other sources told Reuters.

U.S. Border Patrol is on pace to have arrested around 8,500 migrants at the border in February as the end of the month nears, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said. Two other sources said the monthly total would be at or near a record low.

President Donald Trump, a Republican, took an array of actions to deter illegal immigration after returning to the White House on January 20, saying a crackdown was needed after high levels of migration under his predecessor, former President Joe Biden.

Trump's moves included implementing a sweeping ban on asylum at the border and surging military troops to assist border security.

The American Civil Liberties Union sued the Trump administration over the ban earlier this month, arguing it violated U.S. asylum law and international treaties.

The Trump administration also struck new agreements with Mexico and Central American countries to accept U.S. deportees from other nations and has sent some migrants to a camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

U.S. Border Patrol's monthly enforcement statistics go back to 2000. The lowest monthly total on record is currently April 2017, when the agency arrested 11,127 at the start of Trump's first term.

While the number of border arrests similarly dipped at the start of Trump's 2017-2021 presidency - what some called ""the Trump effect"" - they rebounded in some months and years that followed.

The February projection would be a steep drop from the 141,000 migrant arrests in February 2024 and down from 29,000 in January, according to U.S. government figures.

In a filing with Bursa Malaysia, IHH said it is on track to increase its bed capacity of more than 30% or close to 4,000 beds between 2024 and 2028, through the acquisition of strategic assets as well as from capacity expansion.

1567456,US securities regulator files to dismiss lawsuit against Coinbase,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday filed to dismiss its lawsuit against Coinbase, the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, putting an end to a legal battle as the regulator moves to change course under President Donald Trump.

The SEC sued Coinbase in 2023, alleging the exchange flouted the agency's rules and facilitated trading in at least 13 crypto tokens that it said should have been registered as securities.

Coinbase had said last week that the SEC planned to withdraw the case.

Coinbase argued that crypto assets, unlike stocks and bonds, do not meet the definition of an investment contract, a position held by the vast majority of the crypto industry. As outlined in a U.S. Supreme Court case, a key test for whether an investment product is a security is whether people are investing in a common enterprise with the expectation of profit.

The lawsuit also targeted Coinbase's ""staking"" program, in which it pools assets to verify activity on blockchain networks and takes commissions, in exchange for ""rewards"" to customers. The SEC said that program should have been registered with the agency.

The SEC also sued rival trading platform Binance in 2023. A court has separately paused the agency's lawsuit against Binance after a joint request, citing implications of the SEC's new crypto task force, which was established shortly after Trump took office last month.

Republican officials at the SEC immediately began to overhaul the agency's crypto policies, even before the arrival of Paul Atkins, Trump's crypto-friendly pick for SEC chair.

Revisiting cases against crypto firms - especially those which violated the SEC's rules but were not alleged to have defrauded investors - has been broadly anticipated. Many legal experts, however, told Reuters they expected the SEC to seek settlements and any mass effort to dismiss all pending matters would be seen as unprecedented.

1567230,Council beefs up Selayang Ramadan bazaar monitoring,"SELAYANG Municipal Council (MPS) will step up efforts to monitor Ramadan bazaars under its jurisdiction to ensure there is no reselling of trading permits to third parties.

MPS president Shahman Jalaludin told StarMetro that the council would deploy more of its personnel to keep an eye on bazaars in the Selangor municipality throughout the Ramadan period.

He also said traders who were given permits were selected after taking into consideration various criteria.

“This includes the applicant being a Malaysian and has received the typhoid vaccination.

“Traders must have also attended the council’s Ramadan bazaar briefing session,” he said after chairing MPS’ full board meeting.

He said the briefing session was held on Feb 19 at Dewan Beringin in Taman Sri Gombak.

Traders were briefed about hygiene, food safety, enforcement of regulations and solid waste management.

Shahman hoped that the briefing could help traders understand guidelines set by MPS to ensure order, cleanliness and safety at Ramadan bazaars.

This year, MPS prepared 1,970 lots across 31 locations for Ramadan bazaar traders.

Previously, there had been reports that some Ramadan lots in Kuala Lumpur were being resold for huge profits.

Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim had warned that Ramadan bazaar licences found to have been resold would be revoked immediately.

Selangor youth, sports and entrepreneurship committee chairman Mohd Najwan Halimi had also reminded licensed traders to follow regulations and refrain from transferring their permits to third parties, as this could lead to legal repercussions.

On a separate matter, Shahman said the first assessment tax term this year ends today, and a late charge of RM20 would be imposed on those who fail to pay on time.

“The charge will be imposed from March 1 to March 31.

“Seizure warrants will be issued to those who still fail to pay starting April 1,” he said.

He added that as of Jan 31, MPS had collected RM20.79mil in assessment tax.

This is about 31.03% of the expected total sum of RM67mil.

1567226,Dataran Merdeka parking woes,"VISITORS are raising concerns over dirty, poorly lit, and cracked structures at the underground carpark beneath Dataran Merdeka in Kuala Lumpur.

They are also unhappy about several non-functional parking payment machines there, which is causing great inconvenience.

Nadila Abd Rahim said that because of this, visitors tended to crowd at the remaining few machines still functional.

“The machines are also located far from each other, forcing us to walk some distance to pay for parking,” she said.

KC Chong, meanwhile, took issue with poor lighting at the underground facility, which she said posed a risk especially to women.

“Some parts of the carpark are very dark, which may encourage criminals to take advantage of the situation,” she said.

S. Ganesan said the parking facility reflected poorly on Kuala Lumpur and its readiness to welcome visitors ahead of the Visit Malaysia 2026 campaign.

Several parking payment machines at the carpark are non-functional.

“This is a tourism hotspot,” she said.

“What kind of impression are we giving to people who visit?”

Amir Hakim Abdullah found the cracked floors and spots of discolouration on the walls thoroughly unpleasant.

“The relevant authorities should undertake works to repair and spruce up the parking facility,” he said.

Adrian Wong, meanwhile, said stronger penalties were needed to deter vandals and litterbugs in the area.

“I have seen some people throwing used plastic wraps on the ground.

“We cannot always blame the authorities; the public should behave responsibly too,” he added.

According to a banner displayed on site, the carpark operates between 6am and 8pm on weekdays and around the clock on weekends.

1567953,Lenovo wins appeal in UK fight with Ericsson over interim patent licence,"LONDON (Reuters) - Lenovo on Friday won an appeal in Britain in its attempt to get an interim licence to use Ericsson's patents, in the latest ruling in the companies' global licensing dispute over 5G wireless technology.

Lenovo sued Ericsson at London's High Court in 2023, one of several cases brought by Lenovo or Ericsson around the world which has seen the companies trade lawsuits in Brazil, Colombia and the United States.

The dispute centres on the fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms for a licence to use Lenovo and Ericsson's patents. Disputes over FRAND licensing have led to global legal battles in the telecom industry.

In London, Lenovo sought a declaration that a willing licensor would agree to a short-term licence pending the final determination of FRAND terms.

Its application was refused last year, but the Court of Appeal overturned that decision on Friday.

Judge Richard Arnold said in a written ruling that ""a willing licensor in the position of Ericsson would enter into an interim licence with Lenovo"", adding that he hoped Ericsson would now choose to do so.

Lenovo's Chief Legal Officer Laura Quatela said the ruling ""not only confirms that Lenovo is a willing licensee but strengthens and reaffirms our commitment to advocating for transparency and fairness in global FRAND licensing"".

Ericsson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The main suspect, a Danish national, ran an online platform where he distributed the AI-generated material he produced. Users around the world paid a ""symbolic online payment"" to access the platform.

The operation is ongoing, with authorities from 19 countries including Australia, Spain and the United Kingdom involved.

Most of the 25 arrests were carried out simultaneously on Wednesday in the operation led by Danish authorities, said Europol, without identifying the countries where the arrests took place. More are expected in the coming weeks, it said.

1567440,Apple accused of greenwashing in US lawsuit,"SAN FRANCISCO: A group of Apple Watch buyers have filed a lawsuit in Silicon Valley accusing the tech giant of exaggerating how environmentally friendly production of the smart wristwear is.

A civil suit filed Feb 26 argues that two nature-based projects Apple cites to back claims of carbon neutrality are areas where trees would be growing regardless of whether the tech company was involved.

""Apple's carbon neutrality claims are false and misleading because both projects fail to provide genuine, additional carbon reductions,"" the suit contends.

Apple, however, rejects the claims, telling AFP Thursday the company had ""drastically cut emissions for Apple Watch by over 75%, and we are investing significantly in nature-based projects to remove hundreds of thousands of metric tons of carbon from the air.""

The US tech giant claims to have retired 485,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents primarily through the Chyulu Hills Project in Kenya and the Guinan Project in China, according to the suit.

The Chyulu Hills Project purports to generate carbon credits by preventing deforestation but is on land that has been legally protected from deforestation since 1983, the suit maintains.

The Guinan Project claims to have planted trees on barren land but the area was already heavily forested before the project began, according to the suit.

Plaintiffs in the case are asking for class-action status to represent everyone who has bought the Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch Ultra 2, or the second-generation Apple Watch SE.

""Companies engage in greenwashing to capitalize on growing environmental consciousness while avoiding the costs and challenges of achieving genuine sustainability,"" the complaint argued.

Meta is battling rivals including Amazon, OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft when it comes to models for powering AI, and has been incrementally weaving the technology into its platforms since launching its own AI chatbot in 2023.

An independent app devoted to AI would fit into Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg's stated vision of having the most used AI assistant in the world.

CNBC cited people familiar with the matter as saying Meta plans to debut a standalone AI app by the middle of this year.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman fired off a post on X, formerly Twitter, with a link to the CNBC story, writing: ""OK, fine maybe we'll do a social app.""

Meta is also planning to test a paid subscription tier for its AI platform, in a revenue generating tactic used by ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, according to the report.

Meta declined to comment for this story.

The tech giant recently reported surging profits and revenue for 2024, announcing ambitious plans to expand its artificial intelligence infrastructure in the year ahead.

""I expect this is going to be the year when a highly intelligent and personalized AI assistant reaches more than 1 billion people, and I expect Meta AI to be that leading Assistant,"" CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on the earnings call.

1567528,Singapore arrests three in case linked to Nvidia server fraud,"Singaporean police arrested three men for allegedly defrauding an unnamed supplier of computing servers, casting a spotlight on local intermediaries’ role in funneling Nvidia Corp chips around the world.

Two Singaporean men, 41 and 49, were charged for criminal conspiracy to commit fraud on a supplier of servers by making a false representation, according to the charge sheets. A Chinese national, 51, was charged for committing a fraud.

The case comes weeks after Bloomberg News reported that the US was investigating whether Chinese artificial intelligence sensation DeepSeek had circumvented US chip sanctions with help of third parties in Singapore. Local media including the broadcaster CNA reported that the arrests were linked to the shipment of Nvidia chips to China.

The police didn’t provide details on the nature of the fraud or the products potentially involved, nor did they name the server computer supplier involved. The Chinese man was charged for making a false representation that a company named Luxuriate Your Life Pte ""would be the end user of the items,” according to his charge sheet.

Such offenses carry a prison sentence of up to 20 years in jail, the police said in a separate statement. In total, the police are investigating 22 individuals and companies for suspected involvement in fraud by false representation.

Singapore, which has close trade relations with both the US and China, has been caught in the middle of a tech war between the two superpowers. The Trump administration is probing whether Hangzhou-based DeepSeek bought advanced Nvidia chips through third parties in Singapore, by passing US export restrictions on sales of AI training chips to China.

GPT-4.5 comes with improved ability to recognize patterns, generate creative insights without reasoning and shows greater emotional intelligence, the company said.

Microsoft-backed OpenAI said it would begin rolling out GPT-4.5 to ChatGPT Plus and Team users next week, and then to Enterprise and Edu users the following week.

CEO Sam Altman called it ""a giant, expensive model,"" saying the company ran out of GPU capacity to roll out to user tiers at the same time.

OpenAI said the model also has a lower rate of ""hallucinations"", a common issue in which large language models generate false information. At 37.1%, GPT-4.5's hallucination rate compares with the 61.8% shown by GPT-4o and 44% shown by its o1 reasoning model.

GPT-4.5 supports file and image uploads and can also work on writing and coding projects, but does not currently support other advanced features such as voice and video.

1567453,Duolingo forecasts annual revenue above estimates on strong adoption of AI features,"(Reuters) -Language learning app Duolingo forecast annual revenue above Wall Street expectations on Thursday, anticipating a stronger adoption of its subscription tier featuring artificial intelligence capabilities.

The Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based company's shares were up about 4% in extended trading.

The company operates a ""freemium"" model, providing a basic set of features for all users at no cost with additional capabilities available through monthly or annual paid subscriptions.

Duolingo runs two subscription tiers — Super for avid users, and Max, which includes a generative AI-driven feature that simulates natural conversations through video calls.

Over the past few months, Duolingo has expanded the feature to a slew of languages to rake in more subscribers and grow revenue, but the video call feature on its Max subscription added to costs.

It expects revenue for 2025 to be in the range of $962.5 million to $978.5 million, compared to analysts' estimate of $965.9 million, according to data compiled by LSEG.

Duolingo forecast revenue for the first quarter ranging from $220.5 million to $223.5 million. Analysts, on average, were expecting $221.1 million.

""There's a marginal cost to Max, and that marginal cost is we call generative AI models to power what is the most important part of Max, which is the video call, and that did have about a 100-basis-point impact to gross margin,"" Chief Financial Officer Matt Skaruppa told Reuters.

""The first priority is innovating as quickly as possible, experimenting as quickly as possible to drive more engagement, and then the costs will come down over time.""

The firm also forecast adjusted core profit between $259.9 million and $274 million this year, below estimates of $272.1 million, largely due to costs related to its AI video call features.

The company said chatter around the TikTok ban in January and a marketing campaign in which the app's mascot, Duo, faked his death and returned led to a jump in users in February.

The group said it had filed complaints with watchdogs in Norway, Germany and Spain after collecting evidence that Facebook's parent company had not listened to explicit user requests to opt out of data collection and targeted advertisements.

A Meta spokesperson said the company was unaware of the details of the Eko complaints and could not respond, but that it is committed to protecting users' data privacy.

In light of Europe's data protection rules, the U.S. tech giant introduced ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram in Europe that require a paid subscription, and people who agree to be tracked - most users - get a free service funded by ad revenues. Europe's Data Protection Board (EDPB) questioned that policy in 2024 but has not taken action.

""EU data protection regulators must pull Meta into line,"" spokesperson Eoin Dubsky said. He said 5,000 members of the group, which seeks to defend consumer rights against corporations, had asked Meta to stop processing their personal data. With the users' permission, Eko then observed as the company continued to serve them targeted ads.

Dubsky said Eko's goal is to trigger an investigation or action from the watchdogs.

A spokesperson for Norway's data protection authority confirmed it had received complaints from Eko members and that it has relayed them to the Irish Data Protection Commission, the lead supervisory authority for Meta in Europe.

""However, speaking on a general level, the right to object is a key right for individuals, as invasive tracking and monitoring for advertising purposes may violate their fundamental rights,"" Tobias Judin said, adding that Norway would remain involved in the case.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg had said in January the company would spend as much as $65 billion this year to expand its AI infrastructure.

The Facebook-parent did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while Apollo Global Management declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.

Meta also plans to invest $10 billion to set up an AI data center in Louisiana, it said in December.

The amount of electricity used by the Meta data center in Louisiana will be matched by renewable energy, for which the tech firm will be working with utility Entergy.

Last week, brokerage TD Cowen said Microsoft canceled leases totaling ""a couple of hundred megawatts"" of capacity with at least two private data-center operators.

It has stoked skepticism among investors due to slow payoffs and breakthroughs at Chinese startup DeepSeek, which showcased AI tech at a much lower cost than its Western rivals.

1567299,"Verizon FAA system puts US air safety at risk, says Starlink owner Musk","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Elon Musk on Thursday said a U.S, Federal Aviation Administration communication system operated by Verizon is months away from failure and putting air safety at risks.

Musk, the world's richest person and a senior adviser to President Donald Trump who is working on restructuring the federal government, owns the Starlink satellite system which is a rival to Verizon's. Verizon operates the largest U.S. wireless network.

""The Verizon communication system to air traffic control is breaking down very rapidly. The FAA assessment is single digit months to catastrophic failure, putting air traveler safety at serious risk,"" Musk, said in a post on social media platform X.

This week, the FAA said it was testing three Starlink terminals at a government facility in Alaska to address concerns about reliable weather information for the aviation community in that state.

""The FAA has been considering the use of Starlink since the prior administration to increase reliability at remote sites, including in Alaska,"" the FAA said this week. The agency did not immediately comment on Musk's tweet.

On Wednesday, the Washington Post reported that the FAA was close to canceling a $2.4 billion contract awarded to Verizon in 2023 to overhaul a communications system, and awarding the work to Musk's Starlink. The FAA said it has not made any decision on the contract.

Verizon did not immediately comment on Musk's remarks. The company said this week company it was at the beginning of a 15-year contract with the FAA ""that will help the agency modernize its technology. Protecting Americans who rely on a safe, secure and functioning air traffic control system is more important than ever, and our enhancements will help make that happen.""

Starmer has urged the United States to provide a security ""backstop"" for any European forces that take part in a potential peacekeeping role in Ukraine at the conclusion of peace talks that Trump has pushed forward since taking office last month.

Sitting alongside Starmer in the Oval Office, Trump said he thinks a peace deal reached with Russia would hold and said he does not think Putin would invade Ukraine again.

""I think Russia has been acting very well. ... I think we're very well advanced on the deal, but we have not made a deal yet,"" Trump said, adding that he would not talk about the details of peacekeeping until a deal was agreed.

When asked if Putin could be trusted, Trump replied: ""Trust and verify.""

Starmer thanked Trump for ""changing the conversation to bring about the possibility that we can have a peace deal.""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy will visit the White House on Friday and is expected to sign an agreement with Trump on Ukraine's critical minerals. Trump said that deal would be a backstop for Ukraine.

The move undermines state institutions, touching off a constitutional crisis in ethnically polarised post-war Bosnia. Russia, Dodik's most powerful supporter, said the sentence was politically motivated and would destabilise the Balkans.

The court in Bosnia's capital Sarajevo acted after Dodik

signed Serb Republic legislation suspending rulings by Bosnia's constitutional court and international envoy Christian Schmidt, who oversees implementation of the 1995 Dayton peace treaty.

Dodik, in remarks to lawmakers before they approved the law on Thursday evening, cast the move as an act of secession in defiance of the 1990s peace accord that kept Bosnia intact but split into two autonomous regions largely along ceasefire lines.

""This moment is favourable and I call on you to vote for the law without hesitation,"" the Bosnian Serb nationalist leader told MPs in Banja Luka, the regional capital. ""We think this creates momentum for us to do this without the use of force.""

Aleksandar Vucic, president of neighbouring Serbia, and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban also condemned the court verdict against Dodik.

The island's prefect, Patrice Latron, said there were no reports so far of any deaths.

The cyclone made landfall on the north of the Indian Ocean island, which lies off Madagascar, and was making its way towards the southern part of the island.

The prefecture said 145,000 households - about 30% of the electricity utility's clients - had lost power just an hour after the cyclone hit, and 10% had no access to drinking water.

The prefecture said the worst of the storm had passed and the alert had been downgraded from the highest level, purple, to red. A mandatory order to stay indoors remained in place.

Francis, 88, was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on February 14 with what was originally described as a bronchitis and was later revealed to have developed into something more serious.

In a medical update on Thursday, the Vatican said the pontiff's condition had ""continued to show improvement"" but his prognosis remained guarded due to a complex clinical picture.

A Vatican official, who did not wish to be named because he was not authorised to discuss the pope's health, noted that Thursday's statement was the second consecutive one that did not describe the pope's condition as ""critical"".

""Maybe we can say he has passed the most critical phase,"" said the official.

Cardinal Michael Czerny, head of the Vatican's human development office, said in an interview with Italy's La Stampa newspaper that Francis was getting better, albeit ""slower than what we would like"".

Francis, who has been pope since 2013, has suffered several bouts of ill health over the past two years. He is prone to lung infections because he developed pleurisy as a young adult and had part of one lung removed.

Double pneumonia is a serious infection of both lungs that can inflame and scar them, making it difficult to breathe. The Vatican said Francis suffered a ""prolonged asthma-like respiratory crisis"" on Saturday, but there have been no repeats.

There was no immediate reaction from Kyiv to the allegation.

Shevkunov, who has been described in Russian media reports for years as ""Putin's confessor"" - something he has neither confirmed nor denied - has maintained a public acquaintance with President Vladimir Putin since the late 1990s and the Kremlin has said the two men know each other well.

In 2023, he was appointed metropolitan of Crimea, becoming one of the top Russian Orthodox Church officials on the peninsula, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014.

The FSB said in a statement it had detained one Russian and one Ukrainian man in connection with the plot and had confiscated an improvised explosive device. It said the two suspects, whom it did not name, had confessed.

It said that the two men, who it said had been recruited by Ukraine using the Telegram messenger service, had been plotting the assassination attempt since mid 2024 and had planned to kill Shevkunov in Moscow.

Ukraine has taken responsibility for a number of assassinations in Russia since the start of the war in 2022, including pro-Moscow Ukrainian blogger Vladlen Tatarsky in April 2023, and the head of Russia's Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection Troops, Igor Kirillov, in December 2024.

1567449,Soccer-Leicester's Van Nistelrooy finds no safety in numbers,"LONDON (Reuters) - The statistics tell a damning story of Ruud Van Nistelrooy's reign as Leicester City manager and they got worse after a limp Premier League loss to West Ham United on Thursday.

Since taking the helm from Steve Cooper in late November, Van Nistelrooy has won only two of 14 league matches and has now lost 11 of the last 12.

The former Netherlands striker netted 95 Premier League goals for Manchester United but his Leicester side have now gone four league games without scoring, conceding 12 in that time.

He cut a gloomy figure at the London Stadium watching a 2-0 lost to West Ham and the question now is whether he will still be on the touchline when they travel to Chelsea on March 9.

""What do you want me to say?,"" Van Nistelrooy replied when asked whether he expected to still be in charge. ""I keep working, I keep going.""

Leicester are 19th in the table, level with Ipswich but behind them on goal difference and five points adrift of 17th-placed Wolverhampton Wanderers.

""We know the situation we're in, we know the table,"" Van Nistelrooy said. ""We know how quick football can turn around.""

Leicester did muster more attacking intent in the second half which pleased their manager.

""I saw two different halves. I saw a first half where we tried not to lose, and another half where we tried to win,"" Van Nistelrooy said.

Their defence remains a glaring weakness, however, with only one clean sheet all season and 61 goals conceded.

1567442,Soccer-Fenerbahce's Mourinho banned and fined for referee comments,"(Reuters) - Fenerbahce manager Jose Mourinho was handed a four-match ban and fined by the Turkish Football Federation (TFF) on Thursday following his comments about Turkish referees after a match at Galatasaray.

The TFF fined the 62-year-old Portuguese 1,617,000 Turkish lira ($44,000) after he criticised the match officials in a press conference following the 0-0 Super Lig draw on Monday.

The penalties were due to ""derogatory and offensive statements towards the Turkish referee"" and accusations of chaos and disorder in Turkish football, the TFF said.

The TFF said Mourinho's remarks violated sports ethics, promoted violence and disorder and could incite fan incidents.

Monday's game was refereed by Slovenian Slavko Vincic after both clubs requested a foreign official take charge.

Fenerbahce issued a statement on Tuesday defending Mourinho, saying his comments were taken out of context and deliberately distorted.

Former Chelsea, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur manager Mourinho has previously been fined and suspended for his comments about Turkish match officials.

The 2019 SEA Games singles gold medallist suffered another early exit at the German Open, falling to India’s Rakshitha Sree Ramraj 20-22, 21-5, 23-25 in the first round on Wednesday.

Earlier, she had no trouble clearing the qualifying round, defeating Spain’s Clara Azurmendi.

This marks Kisona’s second early-round exit this year, following a similar fate at the Thailand Masters in January, where she bowed out in the second round to Indonesia’s Putri Kusuma Wardani.

Since leaving the Badminton Association of Malaysia (BAM) in 2022, Kisona has struggled to regain top form. However, she ended her title drought last year by clinching the Dutch Open in October.

Even more notably, two months later, she teamed up with Yap Rui Chen in women’s doubles and secured the Nepal International title.

Switching from singles to doubles is not uncommon and has proven successful for several Malaysian players.

Among them is M. Thinaah, who is thriving alongside Pearly Tan, and former men’s singles shuttler Goh Soon Huat, now ranked world No. 3 in mixed doubles with his wife, Shevon Lai Jemie.

Milan are eighth in the standings with 41 points, eight behind Juventus in fourth with 12 rounds remaining. Bologna are sixth on 44.

It was the first time in nearly 23 years that Bologna had won a home match against Milan in Serie A. The match was originally scheduled for October but was called off due to flooding.

Two minutes before halftime, Rafael Leao pounced on a flick-on, breezed past his marker and rounded Bologna keeper Lukasz Skorupski to put Milan ahead.

Bologna equalised three minutes after the restart when a free kick into the box was headed down to Santiago Castro who finished from close range.

Milan protested, claiming the ball had ricocheted off Bologna's Giovanni Fabbian's arm before reaching Castro, but VAR allowed the goal to stand.

Yunus Musah nearly put Milan ahead again just after the hour mark, but Skorupski made a crucial save.

Bologna gradually took control of the match as Milan's defence appeared to lose focus, Nicolo Casale heading against the post from a corner before Nicolo Cambiaghi sent the rebound over the bar.

The turnaround was complete nine minutes from time when Nicolo Cambiaghi reached the byline and sent in a cross that Dan Ndoye, at full stretch, tapped into the net.

Holders Juventus fielded a full-strength side on Wednesday as Empoli made eight changes to the team who lost 5-0 to Atalanta last time out and they secured a famous victory after a penalty shootout.

One of the heroes was 20-year-old defender Luca Marianucci who calmly slotted in the final spot-kick in front of the Juventus fans, having also converted during Empoli's shootout win over Fiorentina in the previous round.

Marianucci, who has been at Empoli since the age of seven, made his senior debut in the first round of the cup in August but has had to bide his time in the league, making his first two starts in Serie A this month.

Alongside Marianucci at the back was 19-year-old Lorenzo Tosto, another product of Empoli's youth sector, whose father Vittorio finished his playing career at the club.

Tosto has just one minute of Serie A football under his belt, a late substitute appearance in Empoli's 4-1 defeat at Juventus this month.

Midfielder Jacopo Bacci made his first start against Juventus. The 19-year-old had made two substitute appearances in the league, and it was his pass that set up Youssef Maleh to put Empoli ahead.

Empoli, without a win in 11 league games, are 18th in the standings, but the youngsters who stood tall at the Juventus Stadium may well play a bigger role for the remainder of the season, beginning at Genoa on Sunday.

""The boys have achieved a feat, writing a historic page for this club and it must also serve us for the league,"" Empoli manager Roberto D'Aversa said.

""I had asked for a game of pride, we went even further. There were three boys from the youth sector on the field. If we play like tonight we will achieve our goal.""

Ringrose received a yellow card, later upgraded to a 20-minute red on bunker review, for a dangerous tackle on Wales centre Ben Thomas that resulted in head-on-head contact, in Ireland's 27-18 win last Saturday.

The disciplinary committee determined that the mid-range entry point of six weeks/matches was appropriate, but after the player accepted committing an act of foul play, they applied the maximum 50% reduction.

That three week/game ban will be cut to two once Ringrose takes part in World Rugby’s Coaching Intervention Programme, which would make him available for Ireland's final Six Nations game against Italy.

Along with the France game on March 8, Ringrose will miss this weekend's United Rugby Championship game for Leinster against Cardiff.

Ireland lead the Six Nations standings after three wins from three and are still on course for the Grand Slam but with France three points behind in second, the French could still win the championship.

The result compares with a loss of 95 million euros in the same period a year earlier. The company does not expect to post a net profit in the full year, despite a strong improvement at the operating level. Juventus' fiscal year runs from July 1 to June 30.

Operating revenue at the Turin-based club rose 29% to 224 million euros between July and December last year.

Juventus pocketed 69 million euros from Champions League's broadcasting rights and ticket sales, which helped it to offset in part the end of its front jersey sponsorship contract with auto brand Jeep, which is yet to be replaced by a new deal.

After dominating the Italian soccer landscape for nearly a decade until 2020, Juventus was hit by an accounting scandal linked to player trading and salary payments, whose consequences included a ban on European competitions in the 2023/2024 season.

Juventus, which has been controlled by the Agnelli family for a century, has beem forced to raise around 900 million euros in capital from its shareholders over the past six years.

Juventus expects to return to a full-year net profit in the 2026-2027 financial year, a decade after it last posted an an annual net profit.

Vice President and first lady, Rosario Murillo, called the decision ""sovereign and irrevocable,"" stating Nicaragua would cease participation in all activities related to the Human Rights Council and its ""satellite mechanisms.""

The UN report, released on Wednesday, accuses Ortega and Murillo, who also serves as co-president, of having ""transformed the country into an authoritarian state where no independent institutions remain.""

The UN experts urged legal action against Nicaragua, highlighting human rights abuses in the Latin American country, which they said follow patterns that have been previously established as crimes against humanity.

Ortega's government in the past has ignored reports from the UN and the Organization of American States, which it says are part of an international campaign against it.

Murillo dismissed the UN report as ""falsehoods"" and ""slander.""

Nicaragua experienced mass anti-government protests in 2018 when Ortega's crackdown on dissent resulted in the death of over 350 people and sparked an international outcry over rights abuses.

The UN report also implicated the Nicaraguan army in the violent crackdown, contradicting previous denials.

The US CBP issued the WRO against the palm oil and palm oil products of FGV and its subsidiaries and joint ventures on Sept 30, 2020, barring entry of these products to the US.

Group chief executive officer Fakhrunniam Othman said FGV is waiting for the agency's response after submitting additional clarifications on labour compliance in mid-February 2025.

""We have submitted the petition to modify the WRO in June of last year. After that, the US CBP engaged with FGV to get additional information on specific issues relating to labour compliance according to the Malaysian laws,” he said.

In addition, group chief financial officer Datuk Mohd Hairul Abdul Hamid said that among the key clarifications sought by US CBP were the working hours and aspects related to the Malaysian immigration laws concerning foreign workers.

""There are certain clarifications that have been requested in terms of the overtime, because if you look at international labour standards, your overtime cannot exceed 60 hours per week whereas in Malaysia, it is up to 104 hours.

""So, they need confirmation on whether FGV has complied with the Malaysian law,” he said.

Thus, Mohd Hairul hopes for a positive outcome, following the submission of the petition to the US CBP to modify the WRO. - Bernama",Business,2025-02-28,253

A third employee caught the error one-and-a-half hours after the payment was processed and the transaction was ultimately reversed several hours later, FT said.

Citi told FT its ""detective controls"" promptly identified the error and that it reversed the entry, adding the incident had no impact on the bank or the client.

The National Assembly’s recent decision to raise Vietnam’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth target to at least 8% in 2025 and double-digit rates in the 2026 to 2030 period shows a high level of consensus across the political system for the country’s new development goals, despite many challenges facing the economy.

Suan said that achieving these targets will be a significant challenge.

Among the risks, the US tariff policies could impact one of Vietnam’s key growth drivers, which is international trade.

He pointed out that Vietnam is largely dependent on international trade, with exports accounting for 90% of the country’s GDP, the second highest in Asean after Singapore with 174%.

In addition, the United States is Vietnam’s largest export market, making up 30% of its total export turnover.

Therefore, if the United States imposes tariffs on Vietnamese goods, the manufacturing and service sectors would be significantly affected.

Export demand may decline due to a slowdown in global economic activity, thus impacting GDP growth.

The semiconductor cycle is also weakening, affecting the country’s high-tech exports.

Foreign direct investment inflows may slow down, as investors consider shifting to countries less likely to face US tariffs.

According to experts from UOB Bank, there are several sectors Vietnam can focus on to increase the chances of achieving a high growth rate of 8% in 2025 or even double digits in the next five years.

However, the growth rate needs to remain stable to avoid overheating and resource waste.

Suan suggested that Vietnam boost public investment to support growth and cushion declines in export and manufacturing activities. — Viet Nam News/ANN",Business,2025-02-28,309

ECB employees are likely to complete their analysis of UniCredit’s purchase of 29.9% of Commerzbank by early March, setting the stage for approval by the regulator’s Supervisory Board later in the month, the source said.

The most recent briefing from the ECB’s supervisory experts, which included different scenarios to evaluate the banks’ solidity, was positive, the source added.

Spokespeople for the ECB, Commerzbank and UniCredit declined to comment.

UniCredit chief executive officer Andrea Orcel, a prolific dealmaker, shocked Germany’s corporate and political establishment by snapping up shares in Commerzbank in September.

He went on to build up the holding in the face of widespread German opposition while pressing for a full tie-up.

The ECB signing off on UniCredit owning just shy of 30% in Commerzbank would clear a significant regulatory hurdle.

Orcel has signalled the need for support from the German government for a full takeover to proceed, a move Commerzbank’s own management has called “hostile”.

He said the effort to accelerate the project was important as it would enrich padi farmers and the country’s food security.

“Among the efforts that can be done are expediting land acquisitions to upgrade irrigation systems and requiring the agencies to provide regular progress reports to the ministry,” he said yesterday after launching the RM1bil infrastructure project to support the five-season padi planting programme every two years in the Muda region at Kampung Pida 4, Ayer Hitam.

She added the decline from 2022’s tax collection which recorded RM40.385bil, was due to reduced tax assessment and tax write-offs.

“Among the reasons behind the reduction was due to appeals by taxpayers (56.2%), court decisions (8.2%) and tax exemptions (35.6%) under Section 127 (3A) of the Income Tax Act 1967,” she said in a statement on Thursday (Feb 27).

Meanwhile, Mas Ermieyati said a loophole that allows LHDN officers to approve tax reductions without a clear limit is causing potential leakages in tax collections.

“The PAC found that the powers to approve tax reductions have been delegated to officers at various levels, including branches or states.

“No fixed limit is given on the tax reductions and this is seen as a loophole that could open the doors to possible leakages,” she added.

In efforts to strengthen the collections process, she said the LHDN has implemented an internal tracking system called ReMS2.0 to detect non-compliance.

The float shows Klopp, a former Mainz 05 player and coach, with wings made of banknotes and holding a can of Red Bull's trademark energy drink along with a football.

""For Kloppo values ​​​​he no longer cares about, used to matter. Because Red Bull lures with a lot of money, he is now falling off his pedestal with a crash,"" the float says on its side.

The Mainz great, who went on to have successful coaching spells at Borussia Dortmund and Liverpool, joined Red Bull this year as head of their global soccer operations, with clubs in Brazil, United States, Austria, France and Germany, much to the disappointment of Mainz fans.

Some Mainz fans are critical of Klopp's decision to join Red Bull, that also owns Bundesliga club RB Leipzig, saying it was financially driven.

RB Leipzig's rapid rise through the divisions a decade ago to reach the Bundesliga thanks to the energy drinks maker's considerable investment was unpopular with many German fans.

The Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Law and Institutional Reform) said that the law which establishes the board needs to provide the Auditor-General with the authority to audit.

“One of the shortcomings of the (former) Legal Profession Act is that there is no such authority,” he said during his winding up speech in Parliament on Feb 27 in response to a question from Cha Kee Chin (PH-Rasah).

Cha asked about the latest update on the audit for the board.

Kulasegaran said that while amendments to the Legal Profession Act were passed last year to allow such an audit, the act has not yet received its royal assent.

“I am informed that once it has been given royal assent and gazetted, an investigation will be promptly conducted by the Auditor-General,” he said.

He also said that the powers of the Auditor-General were expanded recently, where it can audit any other entities and companies that receive public funds.

“If the government allocates funds to any NGO or board or organization or company, the Auditor General automatically has the authority to conduct investigations and then a report can be made,” he said.

Previously, it was reported in November last year that the accounts of the Legal Profession Qualifying Board (LPQB) were not audited in the last 17 years.

Meanwhile, Kulasegaran said that there are no agencies marked red in the Auditor-General's dashboard.

Empoli initially led with a first-half goal by Youssef Maleh, while Juventus struggled to pose any serious threat before the interval, prompting Motta to criticise his side's performance and urging his players to take responsibility.

""Shame. I feel shame for what we saw in the first half and I hope my players feel the same,"" Motta told a press conference.

""The attitude was shameful. Maybe I am wrong because I did not make the players understand the importance of this game and the importance of wearing the Juventus shirt. We made a mistake and that's why we're not in the semi-finals,"" the manager added.

After Khephren Thuram equalised for Juventus in the second half, the match went to penalties where Empoli emerged victorious.

Juventus' Dusan Vlahovic missed the first penalty, and Empoli's keeper Devis Vasquez denied Kenan Yildiz, helping secure the win with Luca Marianucci sealing the victory.

""Now we have to start again, give everything in training, give everything to each other and respect the place and the history you are in,"" Motta added as he urged his players to refocus.

Empoli, promoted in 2021 after winning Serie B, now advance to the semi-finals for the first time since the 2006-07 season, where they will face Bologna in April.

Despite being winless in 11 consecutive Serie A games and recently suffering a 5-0 defeat by Atalanta, Empoli previously knocked out Fiorentina on penalties in the last 16 after a 2-1 victory over Torino in the second round.

The visitors had a full half to make their numerical advantage count, but United dug in to pull clear of the Premier League relegation zone.

Amorim was less happy with how young forward Alejandro Garnacho handled being substituted in order for United to get more defensive players on to the pitch following Dorgu's dismissal.

The Argentine headed straight down the tunnel, rather than joining his teammates on the bench.

The Transport Minister said the wagons comprised 246 units owned by RAC and 204 units owned by KTMB.

Each of the new wagons will come with a 20-tonne axle load capacity and the ability to carry up to 60 tonnes per wagon.

He said the new wagons and leasing model were a significant step towards making rail, especially freight operations, a more sustainable and competitive mode of cargo transportation for the country.

He also revealed that this comes after a pay-as-use contract was signed between homegrown rail equipment manufacturer SMH Rail and RAC last year.

As part of this contract, Loke said that 44 old locomotives from KTMB would be sold to SMH Rail before being refurbished and leased back to KTMB for 25 years along with another six new locomotives.

“The leasing programme will benefit local vendors working with SMH Rail in carrying out maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) activities throughout the lease period.

“This will in turn enhance the capabilities of the local industry, strengthen the national economy, and accelerate the growth of the rail transport sector.

“This also demonstrates how public-private sector collaboration can drive economic growth without a complete reliance on government funding,” Loke said in a speech during the launch ceremony of the new wagons at Sentul KTM station on Thursday (Feb 27).

He added that the government would explore additional methods to expand locomotive and wagon leasing to more private industry sectors, aiming to optimise the utilisation of rail track capacity, which is currently at only 30%.

‘Improving this utilisation rate will ensure that government investments in rail infrastructure are fully maximised as a 40-wagon freight train can replace the workload of up to 80 lorries.

O'Mahony, the 35-year-old battling flanker, won his 112th cap against Wales last week and captained Ireland to last year's title. He also skippered his native Munster for years and led the Lions in the opening test of their 2017 tour.

He is the nation's seventh most capped player, two places behind scrumhalf Murray, 35, who made his debut for Ireland in 2011 and forged a key partnership with Johnny Sexton. He was picked for three successive Lions tours in 2013, 2017 and 2021.

Healy, 37, passed Brian O'Driscoll as the most capped Irishman last year and on top of his 136 caps, the loosehead prop has played a record 287 games for Leinster since making his debut for the province 18 years ago.

""Peter, Cian and Conor have each played a huge role in the success of Irish rugby over the course of their careers ... We are determined as a group to end their careers with Ireland on a high,"" interim Ireland coach Simon Easterby said in a statement.

1567165,Soccer-Liverpool clinching title at home to Arsenal the most enticing scenario,"MANCHESTER, England (Reuters) - Liverpool's march towards the Premier League title could culminate with a win over closest rivals Arsenal at Anfield on May 10 in the most tantalising of the possible scenarios.

Arne Slot's men climbed 13 points clear at the top with their 2-0 victory over Newcastle United on Wednesday, and statisticians Opta have made Liverpool champions-elect with a 98.7% chance of winning the league, with Arsenal at 1.3%.

No team have been so far ahead at this stage of the season and not won the title going back to the beginning of English top-flight football in 1888-89.

Slot, however, does not dare get ahead of himself, saying after Wednesday's win: ""It is still a long way to go, 10 games. In March we only play one Premier League game, so we are not focused on the long term.""

If Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta sees the writing on the wall, he is not saying so, telling reporters before Wednesday's scoreless draw with Nottingham Forest that he would concede the title ""over my dead body.""

Liverpool could have locked up the title sooner but, as Slot mentioned, because of the international break plus two Champions League last-16 games against Paris St Germain and the League Cup final versus Newcastle, they have only one league game in March.

Seven more wins would seal a second Premier League title for Slot's team and their 20th in top-flight football overall. Six of their final 10 games are in their home cauldron of Anfield.

Other potential scenarios have Liverpool clinching the title on April 5 versus Fulham, but that would require them winning their next three matches and Arsenal, who have a game in hand, losing their next four.

Liverpool could also claim the crown at home to Tottenham Hotspur on April 26 or on May 3 at Chelsea.

They became the first team in Premier League history to clinch the title with seven games to go in 2019-20.

Manchester United (in 2000-01) and Manchester City (2017-18) did it with five games remaining.

""Sze Fei and IzzuDdin were only given an explanation about the programme. They have not signed any contract or set any conditions.

The Briton was fastest on Wednesday, the first of three days of testing at Bahrain's Sakhir circuit before the season starts in Australia on March 16, and returned to the car on Thursday afternoon.

""It feels similar, which is a good start. It's where we wanted to start, at least,"" Norris told reporters.

""Nothing’s been majorly addressed, let's say... we’ve just tried to make the car quick all around and add more load, a simple way of looking at it honestly.

""We still want to try and focus on some areas more than others. We’ve struggled a bit more with the rear than we would have liked over yesterday and today. But it’s still early days,"" he added.

""We're not looking at performance or absolute, outright performance. If we went into qualifying now I'm sure we would change some things.""

Norris was runner-up to Red Bull's four times world champion Max Verstappen last year but has already been established as a bookmakers' favourite before Melbourne.

He said the true pace of the car was difficult to tell, with rivals likely running different fuel loads and testing different things.

""The more you can improve the rear, the more everything just gets better,"" he explained. ""But the rest of it feels correct, and it feels like it’s in the same ballpark, and that’s what we want.

""I don’t think we’re expecting to be a big step ahead of anyone... but if we’re just there fighting from the beginning, that’s our target.

Leipzig, back-to-back German Cup winners in 2022 and 2023, soaked up early Wolfsburg pressure in both halves before gradually improving.

They bagged the winner in the 69th minute when keeper Marius Mueller went the wrong way as Slovenia forward Sesko took his penalty, awarded for hand ball.

Both teams came close late in the game with Sesko's close-range effort saved before Wolfsburg, who had hit the woodwork with Mohamed Amoura's header three minutes after the restart, missed a chance with Kevin Behrens.

He emphasised that Asean members must stand united to spearhead efforts aimed at creating greater growth opportunities for the region.

""It is important for us to collaborate closely so we can transform all these obstacles into opportunities for inclusive and sustainable prosperity across Asean.

""The PEDs reflect our determination to collectively develop effective strategies that can leverage each of our unique strengths for Asean's greater good,"" he said.

""There are a few different reasons, some personal views,"" Starc said.

""I had a bit of ankle pain through the test series, so I just need to get that one right. Obviously, we have the test final coming up and a West Indies tour after that.

""There is some IPL (Indian Premier League) cricket as well.

""But the main one at the top of my mind is the test final. Get my body right, play some cricket in the next couple of months and then ready to go for the test final.""

Defending champions Australia play South Africa in the World Test Championship final at Lord's in June.

Starc did not elaborate on the personal views he was referring to regarding the Champions Trophy, which has returned to the crowded global cricket calendar after an eight-year hiatus.

The International Cricket Council (ICC) tournament is being played mostly in Pakistan under a heavy security blanket as the South Asian nation battles two insurgencies and a political crisis that sent its former prime minister and greatest cricket hero, Imran Khan, to jail.

The tournament has also come under fire for allowing India to play all their games in Dubai and avoid the travel demanded of other teams after the game's dominant commercial power declined to play in Pakistan.

Australia will look to book a place in the semi-finals by beating Afghanistan in Lahore on Friday.

Francesco Pellegrino of Italy took silver and Finland's Lauri Vuorinen the bronze in the men's race, while Norway's Kristine Stavaas Skistad claimed silver and Nadine Faehndrich won a surprise bronze for Switzerland in the women's event.

In front of thousands of cheering Norwegian supporters, Klaebo seemed unfazed as he waited at the start, and he quickly settled into his rhythm at the front of the field in pursuit of his fourth straight world title.

He briefly allowed Pellegrino to set the pace before easing past him around the halfway point and attacking on a punishing uphill stretch, building up just enough of a lead to hold off the strong challenge of the Italian.

Realising he couldn't be caught on the final straight, Klaebo eased up before the finish line to celebrate with the jubilant crowd as he finished in a time of two minutes 45.74 seconds, 0.67 seconds ahead of Pellegrino.

Finland's Vuorinen, who has previously only made two individual podiums in his 12-year career, had the race of his life as he held off the challenge of France's Jules Chappaz to claim the bronze by a margin of two-tenths of a second.

In the women's race, Swedish sprint queen Sundling dominated en route to her third straight world title, bursting out of the gate in a furious start before taking over and accelerating away to win in a time of three minutes 3.36 seconds, 2.2 seconds ahead of Norway's Stavaas Skistad.

Confirming this, Kelantan police chief Datuk Mohd Yusoff Mamat (pic) said the syndicates had now turned to the waters of Kuala Besar and several other locations such as Tak Bai in Thailand near Pengkalan Kubor, Semerak and Tok Bali in Pasir Puteh.

He said previously, the Golok River was their main route, but with the tight control implemented by police and border forces, they changed their strategy to sneak in through sea lanes.

""As a result of our intelligence and enforcement operations, the Marine Police managed to detain 25 illegal immigrants who tried to enter the country using the route.

As a result, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim announced the Infrastructure Development Project to support the Five-Season Padi Planting Programme over two years to ensure a stable supply of rice.

""This structural issue must be addressed properly. Many irrigation systems have been in place for a long time and require continuous maintenance, which incurs high costs.

""That is why the Prime Minister announced this project in areas under the Muda Agricultural Development Authority (MADA),"" the Agriculture and Food Security Minister explained.

The project follows a public-private partnership model, where private entities will initially finance the development and maintenance of padi infrastructure in MADA areas, to be reimbursed by the government upon completion.

Deputy Utility and Telecommunications Minister Datuk Dr Abdul Rahman Junaidi said that premises still in the process of obtaining halal certification are also prohibited from promoting Ramadan buffets.

""Based on the information I received, there have been no reports or complaints in Sarawak thus far because everyone is complying.

The restriction also applies to any wording that implies the food is suitable for Muslims to break their fast.

The ban is enforced under the Trade Descriptions Act 2011, which carries fines of up to RM500,000 and additional penalties not exceeding RM10mil, upon conviction.

The group expects full-year revenue between 530 million euros and 600 million euros ($554.65 million to $627.90 million) in 2025, down from 633.2 million euros a year earlier.

That compares with analysts' estimate of 582 million euros, according to LSEG data.

Chip companies have been under pressure as higher demand from artificial intelligence (AI) has failed to offset weak demand for automotive, PC and memory chips.

U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to impose 25% tariffs on cars, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, which could disrupt the global supply chain, has raised concerns globally.

""Consensus expectations for 2025 have remained inflated but investors already expected a significant sales decline, in our view, given the negative news flow on silicon carbide over past months,"" Stifel analyst Juergen Wagner said in a note.

Aixtron shares felll around 10% in morning trade, putting them on track for their worst day since February 2024 and down down 14.4% so far this year.

Aixtron also said it expects first-quarter revenue between 90 million and 110 million euros, down from 118.3 million euros in the same period last year.

Full-year earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) dropped to 131.2 million euros from 156.8 million a year earlier.

U.S. media have said Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the world's largest contract chipmaker and a major supplier to companies such as Apple and Nvidia, has been in talks for a stake in Intel.

Neither company has confirmed the talks, but U.S. President Donald Trump has criticised Taiwan for taking away American semiconductor business and says he wants the industry back in his country.

Speaking to reporters in Taipei, Kuo said that ""no one can shake the foundations"" of Taiwan's semiconductor industry.

""We have to have confidence in TSMC, and the government will fully support the 'sacred mountain protecting the country,"" he added, using an expression that refers both to the importance of the chip sector and TSMC to Taiwan's economy.

The government will not interfere in TSMC's decisions, Kuo said.

""For TSMC to go into the world and have a joint venture in any location, it definitely needs government permission,"" he added.

Large overseas investments need to be approved by Taiwan's economy ministry.

TSMC is already in the process of investing $65 billion in new factories in the U.s. state of Arizona.

Taiwan, which runs a large trade surplus with the United States, could also be subject to wide-ranging import tariffs Trump has threatened to impose to deal with trade imbalances.

Kuo said the ministry was collecting information for government negotiators to talk to the Trump administration on the tariffs issue to seek the best conditions for Taiwanese companies, but he declined to comment on the contents of the talks.

The software-as-a-service pioneer is banking heavily on AI agents to reinvigorate growth at a time when other cloud firms, including Microsoft and Amazon, have firmly established themselves as leaders in the sector while making strides in machine learning.

The downbeat forecast indicates that the spending environment remains pressured, with enterprises withholding new financial commitments owing to still-high interest rates and economic uncertainty.

""Given how poor initial generative AI experiments were for many companies, they're not just writing blank checks until Salesforce shows them Agentforce actually works,"" said Rebecca Wettemann, CEO of industry analyst firm Valoir.

""The next quarter or two will be critical for Salesforce.""

It forecast full-year adjusted earnings per share between $11.09 and $11.17 per share, compared with analysts' estimate of $11.18 per share.

Analysts have said that the company's return to double-digit growth rates hinges on the success of Agentforce — its AI agent builder platform — after it reported single-digit revenue growth in the past few quarters.

Aleksei Andriunin, the CEO of cryptocurrency ""market maker"" Gotbit, was ordered detained following an appearance in Boston federal court on Wednesday, one day after his extradition.

Andriunin, 26, was indicted in October on charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit market manipulation and wire fraud.

He and his company were among 15 individuals and three firms charged following a novel investigation into the crypto sector dubbed ""Operation Token Mirrors,"" in which the FBI for the first time directed the creation of its own digital token to help bait and catch fraudsters in the market.

Andriunin's extradition and detention were announced by the office of U.S. Attorney Leah Foley in Boston.

Prosecutors said that from 2018 to 2024, Gotbit engaged in ""wash trading,"" a form of sham trading, and market manipulation on behalf of several cryptocurrency clients to help artificially inflate trading volume for their tokens.

The indictment cited a 2019 interview published online in which Andriunin described developing a code to wash trade cryptocurrencies to artificially inflate trading volume so they could get listed and trade on larger cryptocurrency exchanges.

Prosecutors said Gotbit made wash trades worth millions of dollars and received tens of millions of dollars in proceeds for its services for cryptocurrencies including Saitama and Robo Inu. Individuals associated with those cryptocurrencies have also been charged.

Andriunin, a Russian national, was arrested in Portugal where he was residing in October when the charges against him and the others were first announced. His lawyers did not respond to requests for comment.

Apple last week withdrew an encrypted storage feature for UK users, after reports that it had refused to create such a backdoor allowing access to messages and photos even for users outside the country. The Washington Post reported that Apple rejected such a demand by the British government.

In a letter dated February 25 to two U.S. lawmakers, Tulsi Gabbard, the U.S. director of national intelligence, said the U.S. is examining whether the UK government had violated the CLOUD Act, which bars it from issuing demands for the data of U.S. citizens and vice versa.

""My lawyers are working to provide a legal opinion on the implications of the reported U.K. demands against Apple on the bilateral CLOUD Act agreement,"" Gabbard wrote to U.S. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, and Rep. Andy Biggs, an Arizona Republican.

""Upon initial review of the U.S. and U.K. bilateral CLOUD Act Agreement, the United Kingdom may not issue demands for data of U.S. citizens, nationals, or lawful permanent residents (""U.S. persons""), nor is it authorized to demand the data of persons located inside the United States.""

In 2022, Apple introduced end-to-end encryption for iCloud backups of its iPhones, meaning that only the user - rather than Apple - has the keys to unscramble the data.

Cybersecurity experts told Reuters that if Apple had chosen to build a backdoor for a government, that backdoor would eventually be found and exploited by hackers.

Apple has sparred with regulators over encryption as far back as 2016 when the U.S. government tried to compel it to build a tool to unlock a terrorism suspect's iPhone.

The baseball games will be live streamed at no extra cost to Prime Video members living in New York State, Connecticut, north and central New Jersey and northeast Pennsylvania — areas that cover a majority of the fanbase of the New York Yankees.

Live sports, a prerogative of cable television for decades, is swiftly moving to digital platforms to tap the larger audience that is ditching cable TV subscriptions for digital streaming platforms.

Streaming bellwether Netflix has increased its investments towards acquiring live sports content, including high-profile events such as the Mike Tyson-Jake Paul boxing match, aiming to diversify its portfolio and attract a broader audience.

It also paid more than $5 billion to be the exclusive home of World Wrestling Entertainment's Raw in several territories from January this year and is considering a bid for Formula 1's U.S. TV rights, according to media reports.

While homosexuality is frowned upon in Muslim-majority Indonesia and members of the LGBTQ community face legal challenges, Aceh is the only province that has criminalised it under Islamic Sharia law and imposes public caning.

The two university students, aged 18 and 24, were flogged at a regional government hall by hooded Islamic religious police officers. The caning was witnessed by dozens of people including their family members.

One received 77 lashes while the other received 82 for providing a place for their sexual activities. They were sent home afterwards. ""They were caned after it was proven that they had a same-sex sexual relationship,"" Roslina A Djalil, the head of Sharia law enforcement in Aceh, told reporters, adding that the men had been turned over to the police by locals.

1566966,Internet celebrity Andrew Tate leaves Romania-report,"BUCHAREST (Reuters) -Internet personality Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan left Romania on a private flight for the United States early on Thursday, news website G4media.ro said citing airport sources.

The Tate brothers are under criminal investigation in Romania on accusations of forming an organised criminal group, human trafficking, trafficking of minors, sexual intercourse with a minor and money laundering. They have denied all wrongdoing.

The Financial Times reported last week, citing sources, that members of U.S. President Donald Trump's administration had pressured Romanian authorities to lift travel restrictions on the Tates, former kickboxers with dual U.S. and British citizenship.

Tate's lawyer and communication team did not immediately comment on the report the Tates had left the country.

Romania's Foreign Minister Emil Hurezeanu said the Tates were mentioned during his brief hallway meeting with Trump’s special envoy Richard Grenell at the Munich Security Conference earlier this month.

Pending the criminal investigation, the Tates are under judicial control, a light preventative measure under which they are required to check in with the police regularly.

Until this week, they were also banned from leaving Romania, a measure prosecutors said they lifted.

""The request to change the obligation of not leaving Romania was approved,"" prosecutors said in a statement on Thursday.

""All the other obligations have been maintained, including the requirement to check in with judicial authorities every time they are called.""

A first criminal case against Tate and his brother failed in December when a Bucharest court decided not to start the trial and sent the files back to prosecutors citing flaws in the indictment.

1567066,"EU top court should rule against Hungary's nuclear state aid, adviser says","(Reuters) - The EU Court of Justice should rule in favour of Austria in its appeal against the European Commission's decision to approve Hungary's state aid for the expansion of its Paks atomic plant, the court's adviser said on Thursday.

The court's advocate-general said Austria had been correct in arguing that the Commission should have examined whether the direct award of the construction contract to Russian company Nizhny Novgorod Engineering was compatible with EU procurement rules.

Opinions of the advocate-general are non-binding, but ECJ judges, who are expected to rule on the case in the coming months, typically follow the majority of them.

Austria launched its appeal at the European Union's top court in 2022 after the bloc's second-highest court dismissed Vienna's case.

Austria sued the EU executive in 2018 for its approval of Hungary's plan to build two new reactors at its Paks nuclear site, south of Budapest, with Russian help following Hungarian authorities' promise to take several measures to ensure fair competition.

Advocate-General Laila Medina said the award of the construction contract had been an ""inextricable part"" of the state aid, which the Commission should have taken into account.

1567085,Kremlin says dialogue with US should move forward but nobody expects quick solutions,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Thursday that it believed dialogue with the United States should move forward as long as there is political will on both sides and a readiness to listen to each other, but said nobody expected quick and easy solutions.

The Kremlin made its comments as Russian and U.S. diplomats met in Istanbul for talks aimed at resolving long-running disputes over their respective diplomatic missions in what is a first test of their ability to reset wider relations and work towards ending the conflict in Ukraine.

Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Trump said Russia would have to make territorial ""concessions"" in future negotiations with Ukraine, but that Kyiv ""can forget"" about joining the NATO alliance.

""We're going to do the best we can to make the best deal we can for both sides,"" Trump said. ""But for Ukraine, we're going to try very hard to make a good deal so that they can get as much (territory) back as possible.""

Moscow says four Ukrainian regions - Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson and Luhansk - are now part of Russia even though it does not control any of them fully. Kyiv and many Western countries reject Russia's claims as illegal.

Asked about Trump's comments, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday: ""What we are seeing is that President Trump himself speaks and is ready to listen to others.

""No one expects solutions to come easily and quickly. The problem at hand is too complex and neglected. But with the two countries' political will, with a willingness to hear and listen to each other, I think we will be able to get through this working process,"" Peskov told reporters.

He said one topic of possible Russia-U.S. cooperation would be joint development of natural resources in the Arctic, but said there were no substantive talks on that yet.

Unions and employers federations began talks on Thursday to modify a deeply unpopular 2023 pension overhaul that gradually raises the retirement age two years to 64.

""Negotiators' objective should be to bring the retirement system's finances back to balance in the near future while proposing real improvements for citizens,"" Bayrou said in a letter to participants seen by Reuters.

""I would like to set a target of 2030,"" he added.

To set the stage for the talks, the independent audit office said last week that France could ill afford to scrap the 2023 reform, which it estimated would cost 13 billion euros ($13.6 billion).

Even with the 2023 reform, the shortfall between pension contributions from workers and employers and payouts to retirees would reach 15 billion euros by 2035 if nothing more is done to reduce it, the audit office said.

Unions want to scrap the increase in the retirement age while business federations want to avoid additional payroll contributions that would increase the cost of labour.

Bayrou, a long-time debt hawk, has said all options are on the negotiating table between unions and employers, including the retirement age, as long as any changes do not leave the pension system deeper in the red.

This week's talks in Cape Town were overshadowed by the absence of several key finance chiefs and foreign aid cuts by major economies like the United States and Britain.

South Africa's Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana said he was ""not happy"" the G20 meeting could not issue a joint communique.

The chair's summary - which has become a feature of multilateral meetings in which participants do not reach a formal consensus - said the G20 supported a rules-based trading system with the World Trade Organization at its core.

On the global economy, it noted growth patterns varied across economies and said various risks and trends had been discussed.

It was not immediately clear how many people were affected by the glitch. Meta's comments followed a wave of complaints on social media about violent and ""not safe for work"" content in Reels feeds, despite some users having enabled the ""sensitive content control"" setting meant to filter such material.

""We have fixed an error that caused some users to see content in their Instagram Reels feed that should not have been recommended. We apologize for the mistake,"" a spokesperson for Meta said.

It did not disclose the reason behind the error.

Meta's moderation policies have come under scrutiny after it decided last month to scrap its U.S. fact-checking program on Facebook, Instagram and Threads, three of the world's biggest social media platforms with more than 3 billion users globally.

Violent and graphic videos are prohibited under Meta's policy and the company usually removes such content to protect users, barring exceptions given for videos that raise awareness on topics including human rights abuse and conflict.

The company has in recent years been leaning more on its automated moderation tools, a tactic that is expected to accelerate with the shift away from fact-checking in the United States.

Meta has faced criticism for failing to effectively balance content recommendations and user safety, as seen in incidents like the spread of violent content during the Myanmar genocide, Instagram promoting eating disorder content to teens and misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Automakers and battery suppliers worldwide are racing to develop solid-state batteries, touted as crucial for longer-lasting, safer, and more affordable EVs amid slowing EV growth.

The project builds on Idemitsu's partnership with Toyota Motor to commercialise next generation batteries and support the automaker's goal of launching electric vehicles with all-solid-state batteries by 2027-2028.

Toyota aims to introduce the batteries to drastically improve the driving range of EVs. Solid-state batteries also offer shorter charging times than traditional lithium-ion packs.

Idemitsu plans to complete the new plant by June 2027, with an estimated cost of 21.3 billion yen ($143 million).

The facility will have a production capacity of 1,000 metric tons of lithium sulphide annually — enough to supply solid electrolyte for 50,000–60,000 EVs, Idemitsu Executive Officer Tetsuji Mishina told reporters at the Chiba refinery.

Idemitsu plans to make a final investment decision on building a large-scale pilot factory for solid electrolyte, a key ingredient for solid-state batteries, in the fiscal year 2025, which ends in March 2026, Mishina said.

It is also seeking stable lithium supplies from Australia and other overseas sources.

""A major challenge for global adoption of solid-state batteries is lowering solid electrolyte costs,"" Mishina said, with the aim to reduce costs so they match those of liquid lithium-ion batteries.

Idemitsu plans to supply solid electrolyte to Toyota first, expanding to other customers later. The company is currently developing two different types of solid electrolyte, Mishina said.

1566317,MBPJ’s first Ponggal do celebrates staff unity,"TO celebrate Ponggal, Indian staff of Petaling Jaya City Council (MBPJ) turned up in colourful garments, bearing claypots and sugar cane.

It was MBPJ’s first Ponggal and celebrants went all out to make the event at Dataran Boulevard, Petaling Jaya, Selangor, a memorable one.

MBPJ nurse Poonkodi Andy, 56, said the event offered a platform for unity among its staff.

“I have been working for MBPJ for 20 years.

“I live at an apartment where many other colleagues live too, and we are like a big family.

“We even have this family-like culture at work.”

She said MBPJ’s Ponggal celebration, held a month after the festival, enabled the city council’s Indian staff to work as a team and that brought all the departments closer.

Speaking on some of her favourite work memories, Poonkodi said: “Some of the children I vaccinated (at MBPJ’s clinic) have grown up and even attended university.

1566314,"Community event highlights need to learn lifesaving CPR, AED use","KNOWING how to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and using an automated external defibrillator (AED) are vital in life-threatening situations such as cardiac arrest, says former nurse Steven Yeoh Wuan Yee.

“The public should also familiarise themselves with the key steps in providing immediate help before professional assistance arrives.

“The first step is to ensure the scene is safe for yourself and the victim before starting the rescue.

“If the victim is non-responsive, ask someone to call 999 for an ambulance, and retrieve an AED device if one is available nearby.

“The next step is to open the victim’s airway using the ‘head tilt-chin lift’ technique.

“At the same time check for breathing and observe if the chest rises, for signs of life,” he said.

Steven said if the person was not breathing, chest compressions should be performed immediately at a rate of 100 to 120 compressions per minute.

“An AED should be attached as soon as possible to analyse the heart’s rhythm and, if necessary, deliver a shock to restore it to normal rhythm.

“It is important to avoid touching the patient while the AED analyses or delivers a shock,” he said.

The director of AED solutions provider MyAED4U has been actively conducting CPR and AED training at various events.

Steven recently conducted a fire safety, CPR and AED awareness programme at a community hall in Bukit Dumbar, Penang.

The event, organised by Bukit Dumbar Village Community Management Council (MPKK), highlighted the importance of acquiring life-saving skills.

Bukit Dumbar MPKK chairman Yeoh Chin Beng said an AED unit was purchased and installed in the neighbourhood, thanks to generous contributions from residents and a local temple.

1566331,Jamaliah: No vape licences under MBPJ,"Petaling Jaya City Council (MBPJ) has not issued any licence to vape traders to operate in the city, says Selangor public health and environment committee chairman Jamaliah Jamaluddin.

Premises found selling the electronic cigarette would be issued a compound, she said in reply to Dr Afif Bahardin (PN-Taman Medan) who asked about the sale of vape in his constituency during the Selangor State Assembly sitting at Bangunan Dewan Negeri Selangor in Shah Alam.

Dr Afif said some vape sellers were so bold that they even displayed large signboards outside their premises.

“We have vape shops next to clinics as well as in front of schools in Taman Medan,” he said.

Jamaliah said the state was cooperating with Health Ministry and the Selangor Health Department to monitor the use of electronic cigarettes, from a health perspective.

The initiative aligns with the enforcement of Smoking Product Control for Public Health Act 2024 (Act 852).

The Act covers regulations on the registration, sale, packaging, labelling and prohibition of smoking in public places, which applies to electronic cigarettes too.

Jamaliah said enforcement on vape product registration and regulation on its sale at display counters will begin on April 1, while enforcement on product packaging and labelling will start on Oct 1.

“The local councils will also be involved in these enforcement operations,” she said.

In addition to these measures, Jamaliah said MBPJ would soon have a workshop to address the vape issue.

The state will work with Health Department to monitor contents of electronic cigarette, particularly nicotine among other chemicals that could be harmful to health.

Other measures included supervising the use of electronic cigarettes in public places, especially in schools, hospitals and food premises, as well as increasing public awareness of the harmful effects of electronic cigarettes.

“This awareness campaign will be carried out in collaboration with community leaders and health volunteers, such as Selangor State Community Health Volunteers.

“They will serve as information delivery agents for the state to the local population and will be responsible for conducting advocacy and awareness campaigns,” added Jamaliah.",Metro,2025-02-27,342
1566349,Over 100 US intelligence staff fired over sexually explicit chats,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said that more than 100 employees from across the intelligence community had been fired for using a secure government chat normally used to share sensitive information to participate in sexually explicit conversations.

In an interview with Fox News Tuesday night, Gabbard described their use of the National Security Administration tool as “an egregious violation of trust” that went against “basic rules and standards around professionalism.”

“I put out a directive today that they will all be terminated and their security clearances will be revoked,” Gabbard said.

Conservative activist Chris Rufo, who writes for City Journal, first disclosed the news Tuesday.

A spokesperson for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said on X Tuesday that Gabbard had sent a memo directing all intelligence agencies to identify the employees who participated in the “‘obscene, pornographic, and sexually explicit’ chatrooms’” by Friday.

In her Fox News interviews, Gabbard said that the administration would continue to ""clean house.""

The office has in recent weeks also moved to fire employees who led diversity initiatives in the Biden administration. It is not clear how many people throughout the intelligence community have been told that they will be fired. That effort has temporarily paused as a federal judge reviews the legality of the move.

1566487,France threatens to review Algeria migration pact in row over deportations,"PARIS (Reuters) - France said on Wednesday it would review a decades-old agreement that makes it easier for Algerian citizens to move to France unless Algeria agrees to take back those who are deported by the French authorities.

Already strained ties between Paris and Algiers have worsened further after an Algerian citizen whom France had long tried unsuccessfully to repatriate killed one person and injured three in a knife attack in the city of Mulhouse on Saturday.

""The drama in Mulhouse was possible because this Algerian citizen was under orders to leave the country and was presented for repatriation 14 times... and each time refused,"" Prime Minister Francois Bayrou told a news conference.

Under a 1968 pact between France and its former colony, Algerian citizens enjoy several exceptions to French immigration laws, making it easier to settle in France.

French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau has repeatedly called for the pact to be reviewed following the Algerian authorities' refusal to take back its citizens who have been ordered to leave France under the ""OQTF"" (obligation to leave French territory) deportation regime.

Bayrou said Algeria's refusal to take back its citizens was ""a direct attack on the agreements we have with the Algerian authorities and we will not accept it"", adding that his government would take four to six weeks to review Algiers' implementation of the 1968 pact.

He said that over that period his government would present to Algeria a list of people it believes should return to their home country. He declined to say how many individuals are on the list but said it was ""substantial"".

""If that is not the case, the government considers that the advantages offered under (the 1968 agreement) will have to be reconsidered... There is a strong feeling that the agreement has been betrayed,"" Bayrou said.

Ties between Paris and Algiers have deteriorated in recent months since France recognised Morocco's sovereignty over the disputed territory of Western Sahara, which Rabat wants the international community to recognise as Moroccan.

That decision has angered Algiers, which backs the Polisario Front that is seeking an independent state.

1566692,Indians throng last day of Maha Kumbh festival that drew 663 million,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Large crowds turned out in northern India on Wednesday for the last day of the six-week Maha Kumbh Mela that drew a total of 663 million people seeking absolution of their sins by taking a dip in waters that devout Hindus consider sacred.

Television images showed security officials trying to direct thousands of visitors around barricades in the temporary township set up in Prayagraj, close to the banks where three holy rivers meet.

""There is a huge rush because it is the last day for all devotees to take a 'holy dip',"" said Rahul, a devotee who gave only his first name.

""Thankfully, we were lucky enough to take a holy dip today.""

Authorities added security and enforced traffic curbs for the last day after many visitors complained of massive crowds that have choked traffic in the area, leading to jams stretching for kilometres.

India has touted the Maha Kumbh, or Great Pitcher Festival, held once in 12 years, as a key religious event setting world records for the largest gathering of people.

As many as 15.3 million people bathed on Wednesday, said authorities in the state of Uttar Pradesh, home to the festival, taking the total figure of celebrants to more than 663 million, or nearly twice the population of the United States.

The last event in 2019 drew 240 million visitors, but this year's event, signified by the term ""maha"", or great, is rendered still more auspicious by a rare alignment of celestial bodies after 144 years.

Indians from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and ministers to business tycoons and television and film actors have participated, along with international figures such as Chris Martin of British rock band Coldplay.

But a stampede last month, on the most auspicious day of the festival, killed dozens of people and injured several, marring authorities' efforts to ensure it went off smoothly.

Devout Hindus believe the waters of the holy rivers Ganga, Yamuna and the mythical, invisible Saraswati, which meet at Prayagraj have the power to absolve them of sin.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, a Republican, sent the subpoenas on Wednesday and also included Amazon, Microsoft, Rumble and TikTok, according to the statement.

""The Committee must understand how and to what extent foreign governments have limited Americans' access to lawful speech in the United States,"" Jordan said in a statement announcing the subpoenas.

A Microsoft spokesperson said the company is engaged with the committee and committed to working in good faith.

Spokespeople for the other companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday.

Jordan pointed to laws in the United Kingdom and other countries in Europe, as well as a proposed law in Australia that could require U.S. tech platforms to remove content deemed harmful by foreign regulators.

The concern is the restrictions could affect what content companies allow in the U.S., Jordan wrote.

The subpoenas seek information on the companies' compliance with foreign laws, regulations, or judicial orders.

Called App Tracking Transparency (ATT), the feature allows iPhone users to decide which apps can track user activity, helping companies like Meta Platforms' Facebook and online advertisers tailor ads to users and measure their impact.

Digital advertising and mobile gaming companies including Facebook say it has made it more expensive and difficult for brands to advertise on Apple's platforms.

The French regulator charged Apple in 2023, saying it was concerned that the company might ""abuse its dominant position by implementing discriminatory, non-objective and non-transparent conditions for the use of user data for advertising purposes"".

It is expected to issue its decision next month ordering Apple to halt its anti-competitive practice and will likely impose a fine too, the people said, making it the first regulatory veto against the ATT.

French antitrust fines can be as much as 10% of a company's global annual revenue.

""The decision is expected in the spring. But we can't comment any further,"" the regulator said.

Apple referred to a July 2023 statement in which it said it holds its advertising business to a higher standard of privacy than it requires of any other developer and that it had previously received strong support from the French regulator and privacy watchdog on the goal of the ATT.

The German antitrust authority earlier this month charged Apple with abusing its market power through its app tracking tool and giving itself preferential treatment, putting the company at risk of a hefty fine.

1567197,Salesforce falls after weak annual forecast puts spotlight on AI monetization,"(Reuters) -Shares of Salesforce fell more than 4% on Thursday after a downbeat annual revenue and profit forecast raised questions about when the enterprise cloud firm would start to show meaningful returns on its hefty artificial intelligence bets.

Salesforce's top boss, Marc Benioff, has made a big effort in recent years to transition the firm beyond traditional cloud computing and toward data-driven machine learning and generative AI to take advantage of the rapidly evolving tech landscape.

But the company's weak annual revenue outlook sows doubt over the pace of monetization for Agentforce — its AI agent builder platform — as its business clouds and subscription revenue lag owing to slower spending from enterprise clients.

""Unfortunately for Salesforce, the focus (on Agentforce) is coming at the expense of the rest of the business, which continues to decelerate,"" said Gil Luria, managing director at D.A. Davidson.

""Since Agentforce may not become a significant contributor for at least a year or two, that means Salesforce will experience even slower growth this year.""

Outgoing CFO Amy Weaver said on Wednesday the adoption cycle for Agentforce is early and the company is focused on deploying the software to customers, but sees ""meaningful contribution in fiscal 2027"".

""For Salesforce, the rather gloomy outlook could quickly turn around but with investors wary of the huge sums of cash that have been spent on chasing the AI dream, it will have to deliver quickly because the competition is fierce,"" said Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell.

Investors have been at the heels of big tech firms, including Microsoft and Meta, to show returns on the billions poured into AI.

Salesforce's fast-growing data cloud remains a bright spot as it is the driving force behind its agents.

Data cloud and AI annual recurring revenue rose 120% last year, which analysts said could lay a foundation for growth acceleration.

Salesforce's 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio is 27.07, compared with Snowflake's 162.52 and ServiceNow's 55.23.

If current losses hold, the company is set to wipe off more than $12 billion from its market value.

West Texas Intermediate retreated to settle further below US$69 a barrel at the lowest closing price this year, following a choppy session in which thin volumes amplified swings. Trump on Wednesday made a series of apparently contradictory statements about his plans to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico and the European Union.

The uncertainty over Trump’s actions and the threat of multiple international trade wars have cast a pall over the outlooks for economic growth and energy demand in both the US and China, the world’s two largest consumers of crude. The US diesel market already is also showing signs of demand weakness, with futures for the fuel sinking 1.9% after government data showed inventories swelled the most since early January.

""Trump actions are hurting consumer and business confidence, which again will weaken actual consumption,” said Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB AB.

Trump on Wednesday first said his planned tariffs on Canada and Mexico would move forward before later saying they would be implemented in early April, about a month later than previously scheduled. The president also said he’d impose 25% duties on the European Union, before shifting to talk about tariffs on automobiles and other topics.

The prospect of increased flows also weighed on prices as the White House confirmed plans for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to visit the US, signalling that Russia’s crude may flow more freely in the near future if a peace deal is reached. At the same time, Iraq reached a pact with the Kurdistan region to resume oil exports.

The trade and supply news overshadowed potentially bullish developments, including Trump’s announcement that he’ll terminate oil concessions the Biden administration gave to Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro, fresh sanctions against Iranian flows and expectations that Opec+ will again defer a plan to progressively raise output. — Bloomberg",Business,2025-02-27,327

For instance, a one-way flight from Beijing to Chengdu, Sichuan province; Lanzhou, Gansu province; or Harbin, Heilongjiang province, all carry a price tag of around 200 yuan, excluding airport construction fees and fuel costs.

A one-way flight from Beijing to Haikou or Sanya, in the tropical island of Hainan province, is around 300 yuan, according to Qunar, a Beijing-based online travel agency.

The elderly who have flexible schedules often embark on trips during this period, and they prefer independent travel and choose destinations largely based on prices.

In-depth tours of Yunnan province, Fujian province, and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area have been favoured by senior travellers, Qunar said.

“The tourism market has entered a long slack season and it will last until the next holiday, which is Qingming Festival, also known as Tomb-Sweeping Day in early April,” said Qunar researcher Xiao Peng.

“March will be a period that is inexpensive and not crowded, suitable for college students, senior travellers and office employees who take annual holidays off work to travel.”

He added that during this period, small towns in China often become popular with tourists.

1566363,Affin Bank FY24 performance beats expectations,"PETALING JAYA: Affin Bank Bhd’s financial year ended Dec 31, 2024 (FY24) results have beaten analyst expectations on better asset quality but surprised with a bonus issue in place of cash dividends.

Kenanga Research said the banking group is looking for more aggressive targets in FY25, intending to build up capital to prime up growth or to seek strategic acquisitions, which it opines could be for complementary business units rather than entire entities.

“Notably, the Sarawak state government does not contribute much to its loans or deposits book. We maintain ‘underperform’ but with a higher target price of RM2.40 from RM2.20 as we roll over valuation base year.”

In the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2024 (4Q24) Affin’s net profit more than tripled to RM135.1mil, or an earnings per share of 5.63 sen, from RM39.5mil or 1.72 sen in the year-ago quarter. Revenue for the quarter rose 14.7% to RM557.7mil from RM486.2mil.

For FY24, the bank posted a net profit of RM509.7mil, up 26.7% from RM402.2mil while revenue climbed 9.3% to RM2.2bil against RM1.9bil in FY23.

Its net interest income was recorded at RM826.4mil, an increase of RM43.5mil or 5.6% as compared to the previous financial period of RM782.9mil.

Affin’s non-interest income for the period under review was RM652.2mil, an increase of RM44.9mil or 7.4% from RM607.3mil registered in the previous corresponding period.

For FY24, the gross impaired loan ratio for the group stood at 1.94% as compared to 1.90% in FY23.

Kenanga Research said Affin’s FY24 earnings of RM509.7mil was within consensus full-year estimates at 105% but above its full-year forecast by 6%. The positive deviation was due to wider-than-expected writebacks registered in 4Q24 from better staging.

No cash dividend was declared for FY24.

Instead, Affin announced a 1:18 bonus issue to reward shareholders, translating to a 6% increase in share base when completed, it noted.

Phillip Capital said it was tweaking its FY25 to FY26 earnings for Affin by accounting for higher loan growth, net interest margin, lower credit cost, offset by higher cost-base.",Business,2025-02-27,336

His B&B, especially designed for the elderly and located in ancient Huizhou town, a popular tourist destination in Shexian county in Anhui province, has only been operating for a year but has already attracted groups of silver-haired visitors from first-tier cities.

As one of the first batch of B&Bs to combine local history, beautiful scenery and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in the county, Wu’s B&B regularly invites doctors to provide health management services, including the likes of medical lectures and TCM physiotherapy, while also providing tourism services tailored to suit the elderly, such as slow-paced travel plans.

“Travel for health is about to see an influx of those born in the 1960s and 1970s, who have the ability and willingness to spend on health management and better tourism experiences,” he said.

The silver economy is providing huge consumption energy in the cultural tourism market.

Statistics from the China Tourism Academy showed that the number of tourist trips made by those aged 60 and above had reached 1.16 billion in 2023 – accounting for 20.6% of China’s total domestic tourists.

This is the latest bid to create more inclusive and enjoyable travel experiences for the elderly.

It plans to create a nationwide network of specialised trains catering to older travelers by 2027 – featuring over 100 designed routes and 2,500 scheduled trips annually.

The Seattle-based chain started laying off workers, a move that chief executive officer Brian Niccol said would increase efficiency and reduce complexity as he tries to reverse a sales slump.

Now, Starbucks’ tech group will turn to third-party workers for certain tasks.

“We are realigning our resource mix of internal and outsourced talent,” according to a memo from Deb Hall Lefevre, Starbucks’ chief technology officer.

The goal is to shift full-time workers to the company’s most important initiatives, according to the memo, while leaning on service providers for “speed and agility”.

Starbucks declined to specify how many roles would be outsourced and to what third-party provider.

An in-house technology team will still exist while external talent will be used for more routine work, according to the firm.

The tech team will undergo a broader reorganisation cutting across data and analytics, engineering and other functions, according to the memo. — Bloomberg",Business,2025-02-27,171

At 6 pm, the ringgit fell to 4.4410/4480 from 4.4260/4305 at Wednesday’s close.

Bank Muamalat Malaysia Bhd chief economist Dr Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid observed that the ringgit was generally weaker against the greenback, just shy of the immediate resistant level of RM4.45.

He also noted that Asian currencies were also weaker against the US dollar.

The decline in the US Treasury yields and the lacklustre performance in the global equities market suggest that risk-off mode may have prevailed. The 10-year US Treasury yield has declined by 33 basis points to 4.25 per cent.

""Such market conditions would typically benefit the US dollar as traders and investors were seeking refuge against market volatility, along with the ongoing net foreign fund outflows in Malaysian equities indicate that foreign investors’ risk appetite has gone down and becomes defensive.

With the upcoming Visit Malaysia 2026, she hopes that street artists, particularly buskers in Kuala Lumpur, will also play classic songs with a modern twist and help tourists recognize Malaysian traditional music like the gamelan and ghazal.

‘Buskers are also encouraged to dress well and appropriately during performances, and interact with the audience professionally and courteously,” she said, adding that batik or traditional wear will also showcase Malaysia.

She said that 16 locations have been designated as official busking areas.

“These include commercial and tourist zones like Bukit Bintang, Jalan Tengkorak Beraman, Dataran Merdeka, Medan Pasar, River of Life, Brickfields, and Jalan Alor.

“Also, in recreational and social zones such as public parks or suitable DBKL food courts,” she said, adding that each location allows operations between 9am and midnight.

Anwar said this during the closing ceremony of the Kedah Federal Village Development and Security Committee (JPKKP) Convention 2025 here Thursday (Feb 27).

As both Prime Minister and Finance Minister, Anwar stressed that he would not allow people to continue living in cramped and deteriorating homes, but would instead use his authority to provide better housing with improved facilities.

Magistrate Hairun Najmi Mashahadi made the ruling on Thursday (Feb 27) after a request from defence counsel Ahmad Lokman Abdul Aziz, representing the 19-year-old accused, Nurul Ain Haslan.

The lawyer, also representing Nurul Ain's 21-year-old boyfriend Muhammad Emer Irfan Hasren who is jointly charged with her, said the evaluation was important because the alleged crime was committed just after the baby's birth.

""We hope the court allows her to undergo an assessment for postnatal depression or postpartum psychosis before she stands trial as there is a need to establish if there was an intention to commit the crime,"" he said.

Nurul Ain and Emer were jointly charged at a Seremban Magistrate's Court on Jan 31.

No plea was recorded from the duo as murder cases come under the jurisdiction of the High Court.

They were charged with committing the offence between 5.30am and 4pm on Jan 21 at a house in Teluk Kemang here.

They were charged under Section 302 of the Penal Code, read together with Section 34, for murder.

Offenders can be sentenced to death, or jailed between 30 and 40 years with at least 12 strokes of the cane, upon conviction.

He said the prosecution had no objection to the defence application for Nurul Ain to undergo a mental health evaluation.

The court then fixed March 27 for mention.

Police were alerted to the case by staff at Hospital Port Dickson on Jan 21 when Nurul Ain, who was seeking postnatal treatment, could not produce her baby when doctors asked.

Assistant Professor Srirat Lapyai pointed out that Prathom (primary school) children have access to these e-cigarettes, which entered the Thailand market for the first time in mid-2024.

This led parents to ask media outlets to write about the matter, she said.

She noted that these disposable e-cigarettes are produced in the shape of popular cartoon characters, toys, candy boxes, juice or milk boxes, collectable figures, key chains and stationery.

They also come in various colours and flavours such as strawberry, mango, peach and blueberry.

“Making cartoon-shaped e-cigarettes is a strategy called harm reduction, aiming to reduce the harm of cigarettes with a cute appearance,” she said.

Prof Srirat emphasised that nicotine from toy pods can affect children’s health similar to general e-cigarettes, though smoking them causes less irritation to the throat.

Toy pods are being sold at 99 baht (US$2.92) each, making them accessible to children, she said, adding that these items are currently available for sale near schools and on online channels.

New types of e-cigarettes pose risks to children, including nicotine that affects child development, said Prof Srirat.

“We are identifying winnable seats and (suitable) candidates before negotiating with our coalition partners.

""Our goal is a win-win situation while avoiding multi-cornered fights,"" said Liew, who is also state Tourism, Culture and Environment Minister.

Speaking after the ministry's excellent service awards ceremony on Wednesday (Feb 26), she said the party is focused on securing viable constituencies and ensuring strong representation before engaging with PKR headquarters and other Sabah Pakatan component parties.

In the last election, Sabah PKR contested seven seats – Tamparuli, Inanam, Klias, Tempasuk, Matunggong, Sook, and Api-Api – but won only two, with Liew winning in Api-Api and Datuk Peto Galim victorious in Inanam.

Sabah Pakatan consists of PKR, Upko, DAP and Amanah.

Last month, Sabah PKR leadership council secretary Sazalye Donol voiced dissatisfaction over Upko, a smaller and newer coalition member, leading Sabah Pakatan.

The party argued that the chairmanship has traditionally been held by PKR and was never subject to a selection process.

Although Upko president Datuk Ewon Benedick won the role by three votes, Sazalye said the process was unprecedented and that they await coalition chairman and Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim’s final decision.

He also claimed Sabah PKR was not properly informed about key meetings, including the Sabah Pakatan annual general meeting on Dec 1, where their request for a postponement was denied.

Sazalye questioned Upko’s eligibility to lead, citing its recent entry into Pakatan, and suggested DAP would have been a more reasonable choice.

Despite the disagreement, he denied an internal crisis, stating it has not affected coalition relations.

After receiving the call for help from their fellow teammates, the Baise public security bureau immediately activated its emergency response mechanism, mobilizing police, emergency services, fire departments, and medical teams.

The main chamber's maximum length is approximately 200 meters and its widest section is about 80 meters, with water depths exceeding 15 meters.

The rescue team used five 200-meter long reels to deploy guide ropes from the cave's entrance to help navigate the underwater terrain.

After over four hours of diving operations, the first missing explorer was located at 4.30am on Feb 6, about 16 meters underwater in an air chamber, roughly 300 meters from the initial search point.

Except for the Moon, stargazers can observe Saturn, Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, and Mars with the naked eye until Feb 28. A telescope is recommended to observe Uranus and Neptune.

“This is a great opportunity to see multiple planets at once,” Narit said.

The institute explained that planetary alignments occur when planets reach positions in their orbits that make them appear in the same region of the sky from Earth's perspective.

However, this alignment does not mean the planets are physically in a straight line when viewed from space.

What makes the phenomenon special is that all planets will appear in the sky in the early evening, the institute said, adding that this phenomenon occurs rarely.

Stargazers who miss this week’s alignment can observe the phenomenon again on March 1-5, when all planets will be visible. Another chance will occur from March 6-15, though Saturn will not be observable during this period.

Narit also invites people to participate in stargazing activities every Saturday at Princess Sirindhorn AstroPark in Mae Rim, Chiang Mai, as well as at Regional Observatories for the Public in Nakhon Ratchasima, Khon Kaen, Chachoengsao, and Songkhla.

1566922,"Singapore man sexually assaulted intellectually disabled daughter, 11, in shared bedroom over three years","SINGAPORE: A father broke the trust of his daughter and the sanctity of their home by sexually assaulting her in a shared bedroom over a period of three years.

His daughter was later sent to a foster home in 2022, after he separated from his wife a year earlier.

The sexual assaults only came to light in 2023, when his daughter told her foster parents that she had been touched inappropriately.

The court that heard the first incident had taken place when the girl was just 11 years of age. The prosecution said the man had been unaware that his daughter is intellectually disabled.

Court documents showed the man, 55, married his wife in 2006. The couple have two daughters, including the victim.

The man, his wife and two daughters would sleep on four single mattresses placed side by side in a shared bedroom at home.

The court heard that the arrangement was the man would lie beside his wife, followed by his two daughters.

Sometime between 2018 and April 2019, the man waited until everyone was asleep before going to his daughter, who was 11 years old at the time. She was lying on the mattress furthest from him.

He then molested her over her clothes, kissed her on the lips, and made her touch him inappropriately.

The child agreed as she was afraid of him. The court heard that she did not verbally or physically resist her father as she had seen him beating her mother on a previous occasion.

In December 2020, he sexually assaulted his daughter again while she was asleep.

Around the same period, he assaulted her for the third time.

The court heard that his daughter had tried to turn her body away this time, but he carried on sexually assaulting her.

The daughter later shared her experiences with her foster parents, who alerted her child protection officer on March 9, 2023.

The man will return to court on April 3 to be sentenced. The prosecution is seeking a jail term of six years and five months for the man.

1566869,Global hacker arrested in Thailand after collaboration between Thai and Singapore police,"SINGAPORE: A 39-year-old man believed to be responsible for at least 75 hacking cases across the globe was arrested in Thailand on Wednesday (Feb 26).

His arrest came after a cross-border operation between the Singapore Police Force (SPF) and the Royal Thai Police, said the SPF in a statement on Feb 27.

Investigations into the data breaches began in 2020 after 11 victims in Singapore filed police reports. The victims had been subjected to ransom demands from several threat actors after having their data stolen.

The threat actors identified themselves as Altdos, Desorden, GhostR and 0mid16B, said the statement, adding that the multiple aliases were likely to be connected to the same person.

When victims failed to pay the ransom demanded, their stolen data would be published online for sale.

Desorden made the news in 2021 after the person leaked data from employment agency Protemps Employment Services online, making it available for €2.10 (S$3).

Desorden also claimed responsibility for two hacking incidents involving PC vendor Acer in India and Taiwan.

According to digital risk monitoring platform CloudSEK, Desorden primarily targeted firms in Asia, focusing on conglomerates with high revenues.

Altdos was behind the hacking of real estate firm OrangeTee & Tie in August 2021, which led to the information of more than 250,000 customers, employees and agents being compromised.

The statement said that officers from the Cybercrime Command in SPF worked closely with the Thai police to share findings from their investigations.

The collaboration helped establish the identity of the suspect, who is believed to be also responsible for several data breach cases in Thailand. His nationality was not mentioned in the SPF statement.

Thai police have seized assets worth more than 10 million baht (S$395,500), including laptops, mobile phones, luxury vehicles and branded bags.

Investigations are ongoing.

Expressing his appreciation to the Royal Thai Police, Assistant Commissioner of Police Paul Tay reiterated SPF’s commitment to working closely with regional partners.

A small bench was later installed as a resting space for residents in 1988, but it had not been registered as a park.

1566803,New Australian blood test capable of detecting pregnancy health complications earlier,"SYDNEY: Australian scientists have developed a new blood test capable of detecting health complications early in pregnancy.

The research team from the University of Queensland (UQ) said in a study published on Thursday (Feb 27) that their ""nanoflower sensor"" could help reduce hospital admissions for newborn babies.

The test screens blood samples for cell biomarkers and can detect complications such as gestational diabetes, preterm birth risks and high blood pressure as early as 11 weeks into a pregnancy.

Carlos Salomon Gallo from UQ's Centre for Clinical Research said that the team tested the sensor on blood samples from 201 pregnant women at 11-13 weeks gestation and detected possible complications.

""Currently, most pregnancy complications can not be identified until the second or third trimester, which means it can sometimes be too late for effective intervention,"" he said in a media release.

""However, with this technology, pregnant women will be able to seek medical intervention much earlier. We also found our biosensor has more than 90 per cent accuracy in identifying women at risk of developing pregnancy complications.""

He said that the technology could save the healthcare system millions of dollars every year by reducing neonatal intensive care unit admissions and preventing emergency pregnancy interventions, including cesarean section.

""This has the potential to revolutionise earlier risk assessment and interventions, improving clinical decision-making in obstetric care,"" Salomon Gallo said.

Mostafa Kamal Masud, a co-author of the study from UQ's Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, said that the technology used nanosensors to detect low concentrations of biomarkers indicating possible health complications that are missed by current less sensitive testing methods. - Xinhua",Politics,2025-02-27,269

The latest incident involved a foreign couple who were allegedly having sex in the open on Kratinglay beach, according to local media over the weekend.

A witness, an 18-year-old man known only by the pseudonym Bew, told reporters he had noticed the duo when he was relaxing on the beach with friends.

He added there were other visitors on the sand but the couple seemed unfazed even after he urged them to stop.

""I did not expect that anyone would dare to have sex on the beach with so many people around.

""It was shocking to me. They should go to a hotel for that,"" he was quoted by Thaiger, a bilingual news outlet, as saying.

Penalties for public sex in Thailand vary from 500 baht (US$15) to prison sentences, according to Pattaya Mail. Foreigners caught may also face repatriation.

Pattaya, famed for its red-light district, has been plagued by problems of indecent tourist behaviour and beachside prostitution.

In December, Thai media reported that a Chinese man and a local woman, both in their 50s, were arrested on suspicion of having sex in the waters off Jomtien beach in the city.

The couple reportedly engaged in intercourse for more than half an hour despite repeated warnings from bystanders, and police took action after receiving multiple complaints.

Authorities have traditionally adopted a relaxed approach to the sex industry in Pattaya, with the city relying heavily on tourism to generate income and its seedy reputation a draw for foreign visitors, according to Pattaya Mail.

But police were gradually changing their attitude, the newspaper noted.

Pattaya law enforcement shut down a prostitution ring comprising 20 foreign women on Dec 27 last year, local media reported.

The women, aged between 26 and 51 and from various central Asian and African countries, admitted they had flown into Thailand to offer sex services to foreign men.

“At this stage, it is too early to determine the long-term impact on global metal flows and regional pricing as the market awaits further clarity. Nevertheless, our direct exposure to the US market remains minimal.

The group noted that fresh fruit bunches (FFB) production for FY2024 declined slightly year-on-year, impacted by adverse weather conditions and a lower cropping trend.

This agreement signals an end to tenuous negotiations between Apple and Indonesia, which last year banned sales of the iPhone 16 due to Apple's failure to meet requirements on locally-made components.

Minister Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita said the months-long negotiations with Apple had been ""tricky"", but the firm was now in the process of obtaining a local content certificate to sell its handsets.

""There's a principle of justness that we're trying to uphold,"" Agus told a press conference. ""As much as it can add value to the red and white,"" he said, referring to the national flag.

Analysts have said the local content rules could hurt investor confidence and trigger protectionism concerns.

As part of the agreements with Apple worth more than $300 million, the firm will invest in a software research and development centre near the capital Jakarta, plus plants to produce components for its products, including its AirPods headphones, Agus said.

Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the agreements. News website CNN Indonesia quoted an Apple representative on Wednesday as saying it was happy to expand its investment in the country and offer all its products to consumers.

Apple has no manufacturing facilities in Indonesia, a country of about 280 million people, but since 2018 it has set up local developer academies.

Companies can usually meet Indonesia's composition requirements through local partnerships or by sourcing parts locally.

WHY IT'S IMPORTANT

Chinese startup DeepSeek triggered a $1 trillion-plus sell-off in global equities markets last month when it unveiled a cut-price AI reasoning model that outperformed many Western competitors and is now rushing to launch a new AI model, according to three sources.

Telekom CEO Tim Hoettges said he expected demand for data centres to increase by at least 30% in Europe, despite the advancement of programmes such as DeepSeek that make do with less computing power.

Deutsche Telekom is investing into data centres and is in the process of building four of them in Europe, aiming to build up to one gigawatt of infrastructure, he said.

KEY QUOTES

""We need data centres in Europe and in Germany,"" Hoettges said at the German telecom giant's press call after publication of its annual results earlier on Wednesday.

""We simply have to realize that Europe is in competition with America and Asia and we can't rely on there being a rich uncle somewhere who will supply us accordingly,"" Hoettges said.

""More computing power is a must-have for the future growth of our economy and it is a must for Europe's sovereignty that it needs in the digital age. We will make our contribution,"" he added.

CONTEXT

Earlier in February, European politicians met with the technology sector in Paris to discuss the development of AI.

At the AI summit, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced an aim of mobilising 200 billion euros ($210 billion) in private and public funding to expand Europe's AI infrastructure, committing 50 billion euros of funding from the European Union.

That goal compares to up to $500 billion of U.S. private sector investments in AI infrastructure announced by President Donald Trump last month.

A government source confirmed to AFP on Tuesday that terms for the lifting of the ban had been agreed, without providing more details.

Apple Indonesia, the Industry Ministry and the Investment Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Jakarta rejected a US$100mil (RM442.71mil) investment proposal from Apple in November, saying it lacked the ""fairness"" required by the government.

The negotiation deadlock forced Apple to later offer an investment of US$1bil (RM4.42bil) to build an AirTag factory in the country.

Despite the sales ban, the government had allowed iPhone 16s to be carried into Indonesia if they were not being traded commercially.

Indonesia also banned the sale of Google Pixel phones for failing to meet the 40% parts requirement.

1565975,Uber CEO says Elon Musk wants to go alone on Tesla robotaxi rollout,"Uber Technologies Inc chief executive officer Dara Khosrowshahi said Elon Musk was not open to making Tesla Inc’s planned robotaxis available on the ride-sharing platform, making Uber a future competitor.

""I’ve had conversations with him at this point,” Khosrowshahi said Friday in an interview with Bloomberg TV’s Manus Cranny at the FII conference in Miami. ""They want to build it alone, so to some extent in Austin, we and Waymo will be competing with Tesla when they launch,” he said, referring to Alphabet Inc’s autonomous-vehicle unit. ""Life is long, but we would love to partner with them.”

Khosrowshahi added that it would make ""a lot of economic sense” for Uber to be a platform for Tesla drivers. ""What we bring is demand to the AV ecosystem when demand often is quite variable.”

A Tesla spokesperson did not respond to an emailed request for comment.

Uber executives have dedicated more time in their earnings calls and other presentations to elaborate on the company’s AV strategy. Since 2023, it’s struck more than a dozen manufacturer partnerships and has invested in multiple self-driving technology companies.

Some Wall Street investors have been nervous about the future of Uber and rideshare peer Lyft Inc’s business model, which currently relies on a large population of human drivers that are quickly matched with riders.

The launch of Tesla robotaxis and the broader rollout of Waymo rides could hurt Uber’s ride volume growth and lower the commission rate it can make, Bloomberg Intelligence has said.

While Uber will launch autonomous rides with Waymo in Austin next month and in Atlanta over the summer, Waymo also offers driverless rides through its own consumer app in other key markets, including San Francisco and, starting next year, Miami. – Bloomberg",Tech,2025-02-26,289

1565816,Adobe releases Photoshop for iPhone with Android to come later,"Adobe Inc released its popular Photoshop editing app for the iPhone, the first smartphone release of the industry-leading creative software.

The mobile launch adds to Adobe’s Photoshop app for Apple Inc’s iPad and the company plans a release for Alphabet Inc’s Android later in the year, it said on Feb 25. Many of Photoshop’s core features are available in the free version, including generative AI that can fill gaps in an image or editing photos in layers, and there’s a US$7.99 (RM35) subscription that adds premium features.

San Jose-based Adobe has long been a leader in design and creative software on the desktop. However, it hasn’t found great success in translating that strength over to mobile platforms. The competition for photo-editing apps on smartphones is fiercer, and Photoshop ranked only 29th in its category in downloads in the US after its launch. Top of the photo and video category were ByteDance Ltd’s CapCut video editor, Instagram and Canva Inc’s editing app. Adobe’s own Lightroom, tailored for processing photos, ranked ninth on Wednesday.

Adobe has made an effort to give users a robust set of tools even without signing up for a subscription, and its premium plan includes access to Photoshop on the web and additional features on mobile and iPad. The iPhone app marks a major expansion of the company’s reach and will be a test of the appeal of Adobe’s artificial intelligence-powered features with a broader consumer audience. – Bloomberg",Tech,2025-02-26,241

Meta executives have informed data center developers that the company is considering building the campus in states including Louisiana, Wyoming or Texas, with senior leaders having visited potential sites this month, the report said.

Since the launch of Microsoft-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT in 2022, investment in AI has surged as companies across various sectors strive to incorporate artificial intelligence into their products and services.

A Meta spokesperson denied the report, saying its data center plans and capital expenditures have already been disclosed and that anything beyond that is ""pure speculation"".

Last month, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that the company plans to spend as much as $65 billion this year to expand its AI infrastructure.

In comparison, Microsoft said it was planning to invest about $80 billion in fiscal 2025 to develop data centers, while retail giant Amazon stated that its 2025 spending would be higher than the $75 billion estimated in 2024.

1565719,"Embattled founder Richard White takes on WiseTech chairman role, shares rise","(Reuters) -Australian logistics software maker WiseTech Global appointed former CEO Richard White as its executive chairman on Wednesday, even as the firm's board and investors remain split over the billionaire founder's role following a flurry of controversies.

The move comes as the company navigates a tumultuous period marked by media allegations of misconduct, corporate governance concerns and a sagging share price.

WiseTech, which was founded by White in 1994, has seen its stock price whipsawed over the past few months, losing around 14% since last October, when the tech firm said it had been reviewing matters related to White.

The media furore about White's personal life prompted the founder to step down and transition to a long-term consulting role in late October.

Shares of the firm were trading 2.5% higher at A$96.91 per share, as of 0306 GMT. Earlier in the day, the stock rose as much as 8.4%, marking its best intraday percentage gain since October 25, 2024.

Philip Pepe, a senior equities analyst at Shaw and Partners, noted that some investors would have been concerned if White had severed ties with the company, as he has been ""instrumental in driving the product vision"" at WiseTech.

Chairman Richard Dammery along with three other directors are set to step down from the board due to ""intractable differences"" and ""differing views"" around White's role, the company said.

Now appointed executive chairman, White will oversee succession planning, including finding a permanent CEO, alongside the nomination committee.

Andrew Cartledge, former chief financial officer, is currently serving as the acting CEO.

Separately, WiseTech also reported underlying net profit after tax of $112.1 million in the first half of fiscal 2025, a 34% jump from a year earlier, helped by strong growth in its flagship software CargoWise.

Shares of the California-based company rose 6.7% in extended trading.

Cooling inflation and a stable job market are encouraging businesses to hire, boosting demand for workforce management solutions such as those offered by Workday.

The company's incorporation of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and machine learning into its product offerings has further improved investor confidence.

""Our fourth quarter results were driven by solid performance across key growth areas of the business, including continued momentum with our full suite and financials products, growing demand for our AI SKUs, and strong execution across industry verticals,"" said CFO Zane Rowe.

The company recently launched the Workday Agent System of Record to help organizations manage all their AI agents, from Workday and third-party sources alike.

Earlier in February, Workday said it would cut around 1,750 jobs, or 8.5% of its current workforce, as the human capital management firm invests heavily in artificial intelligence to counter a softer macroeconomic environment.

Total revenue for the fourth quarter ended January 31 came in at $2.21 billion, beating analysts' estimates of $2.18 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.

The company reported subscription revenue of $2.04 billion, while analysts were expecting $2.03 billion.

Workday forecast subscription revenue for the first quarter to be $2.05 billion, compared with expectations of $2.06 billion.

The company's fiscal 2026 subscription revenue forecast of $8.80 billion is in line with estimates.

1566332,Guinea-Bissau opposition vows to 'paralyse' country in election timing row,"BISSAU (Reuters) - Guinea-Bissau's opposition has vowed to bring the West African country to a standstill on Thursday in a dispute over when the five-year mandate of President Umaro Sissoco Embalo expires.

Opposition leaders say Embalo's term runs out on Thursday, while Guinea-Bissau's Supreme Court of Justice has ruled that it ends on September 4.

Embalo said on Sunday that presidential and legislative elections would not be held until November 30, heightening tensions over the electoral calendar that risk unrest in a nation with a history of military coups.

""We are going to paralyse the country completely on February 27 ... Bissau will be a dead city,"" said a statement issued on Tuesday by the PAI Terra Ranka coalition, led by the former ruling PAIGC party, and the Cabaz Garandi coalition.

Parliamentary elections scheduled for November 2024 were indefinitely postponed by the government, which cited technical and financial obstacles, scrambling the electoral calendar.

Embalo, a 52-year-old former army general, inherited a long-running political impasse in a country where coups and unrest have been common since independence from Portugal in 1974.

He has said there have been two attempts to overthrow him during his presidency, the latest in December 2023.

Embalo dissolved the opposition-controlled parliament after that last incident which involved gunfire and clashes in the capital, accusing it of passivity.

Embalo, who was in Moscow on Wednesday for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, said last year his wife had dissuaded him from running for a second term in elections.

The West African regional bloc ECOWAS plans to deploy a mission to Guinea-Bissau to try to resolve the dispute over the political calendar, it said in a statement last week.

However, the opposition refused to meet ECOWAS representatives during its visit, accusing the mission of bias, the PAI Terra Ranka coalition said on Monday.

Malvern, Pennsylvania-based Cantaloupe provides digital payments technology and software to companies providing self-service offerings, such as vending machines, car washes and arcades. Its products are used in North America, Europe and Australia, according to its website.

The company is working with investment bankers at JPMorgan Chase on the strategic plans, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential deliberations. They warned that a sale was not guaranteed.

Shares in Cantaloupe traded almost 10% higher on news of the sale effort, before giving up their gains.

Cantaloupe and JP Morgan did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Cantaloupe's stock has gained almost 60% since the start of September to give it a market value of around $750 million. The company carries minimal debt.

Mergers and acquisition activity in the digital payments space has been sporadic in the last two years, as many companies struggled to live up to the hype around e-commerce stemming from the pandemic which had turbocharged valuations.

But deal flow involving companies that provide niche payments - such as serving certain industries, or geographies, for example - has been active as large payments companies seek to complement their existing capabilities.

Private equity firms have also been keen buyers of payments companies, betting on the long-term trend towards digitalization of payments and the opportunity of scaling up through future dealmaking.

Such deals in the space include Shift4 Payments agreeing earlier this month to purchase duty-free focused Global Blue for $2.5 billion, and Genstar Capital striking a deal to take a significant stake in AffiniPay, which provides payments to professionals such as accountants and lawyers.

1565691,Dassault Systèmes partners with Apple to put industrial 3D software on Vision Pro,"(Reuters) - Dassault Systèmes on Tuesday said that it has worked with Apple to integrate Apple's Vision Pro into its 3D software, which is widely used in manufacturing, life sciences and urban planning.

France-based Dassault Systèmes has hundreds of thousands of customers who use its software to design cars, airplanes and factories, according to the company. It creates what are known as ""digital twins"" of real-world objects and places, recreating them with a high enough degree of accuracy that designers and engineers can make changes to the digital version and be confident that those changes will work in the real world.

Dassault Systèmes said that starting this summer, the company will release an app called ""3DLive"" that will allow engineers and designers to collaborate on a 3D model in real time and remotely.

Tom Acland, chief executive of the firm's 3DEXCITE unit, said possible real-world uses could be helping find potential problems in accessing manufacturing machines for maintenance long before they are installed on a factory floor, after which rearranging them could be far more expensive.

""Those things tend to only get discovered very late in the process,"" Acland told Reuters. ""But if you could allow the maintenance engineer to walk into the line of equipment before it arrives, they can start to design those maintenance procedures before the equipment ever arrives.""

Dassault Systèmes' app will require deep collaboration with Apple because it represents 3D models with the level of scientific accuracy required by tapping into the Vision Pro's sensors and computing power, which comes from the same chips used in Apple's Mac computers. Hashing out problems with, for example, aircraft designs requires more accuracy than other apps like video games.

""It's not just a gimmick - it's actually a very powerful tool for engineers and designers to make decisions,"" Mike Rockwell, vice president of Apple's vision products group, told Reuters. ""You're able to make these decisions earlier in the process, and that can save you huge amounts of money and time and rework.""

Russian and Portuguese news outlets have quoted a Guinea-Bissau minister as saying Russian aluminium company Rusal is interested in building a railway and port in the country and exploring for bauxite.

Embalo took office in 2020 and his term expires this year, although there is a dispute with the opposition over the timing of the next election. The opposition has vowed to bring the country to a standstill on Thursday in the row which centres on when Embalo's mandate runs out.

Bild newspaper reported that a German-language propaganda site run by IS had published a computer-created collage image calling on viewers to ""choose your next attack target"", and listed the dates and locations of upcoming carnival events.

The Festival of Love planned in the Dutch city of Rotterdam in early March was also listed as a target on the collage featuring a bloody knife and the hashtag #LetsSlaughter.

Germany experienced a series of high-profile attacks, including a car-ramming and stabbings, with Islamist connections in the lead-up to national elections on February 23.

The week-long carnival celebrations, which kick off on Thursday, take place in some predominantly Catholic southern and western parts of Germany, with revellers packing the streets to party, consume large quantities of alcohol and dance.

It is particularly popular in Rhineland cities such as Cologne and Duesseldorf, where festivities peak on ""Rose Monday"" next week with tens of thousands attending street parades featuring comical or satirical floats.

Cologne police said operational planning for the events was being adapted to take the threat into account, but they said the collage could be scaremongering aimed at unsettling the population rather than evidence of an imminent threat.

More than 1,400 officers will be stationed at known hotspots, emergency services will be out in full force and there will be bag and personal searches of carnival goers.

1565610,Letshanaa in line for harrowing time following Jakobsen’s withdrawal,"PETALING JAYA: The challenge has got tougher for women’s singles shuttler K. Letshanaa in the German Open.

World No. 53 Letshanaa will take on Denmark’s Line Christophersen in the first round in Mulheim today after the latter’s teammate Julie Dawall Jakobsen withdrew from the tournament.

Initially, the 21-year-old was supposed to play world No. 34 Jakobsen but her withdrawal saw world No. 36 Christophersen replacing her in the draw.

Singles head coach Kenneth Jonassen believes that Christophersen poses a more difficult threat to Letshanaa than Jokobsen despite being ranked slightly lower.

Jonassen, who used to be head coach of the Danish national team, is familiar with his former charge’s capabilities.

“I believe Christophersen is a much tougher opponent. It will be a strong challenge for Letshanaa to follow her opponent’s pace,” said Jonassen.

“Christophersen has won the Danish National Championships six times in a row. Her last win came just three weeks ago.

“She is a powerful player and always seeks the initiative and control in every rally.

“It will be very important to gain control and be more aggressive. At the same time, it’s important to maintain the quality of play and not to get caught out of balance,” added Jonassen.

This will be first meeting between Letshanaa and Christophersen in an international tournament.

If the former manages to pull off an upset, she will likely face Indonesia’s world No. 40 Komang Ayu in the second round.

The former has never made it beyond the early rounds in a World Tour Super 300 competition and is hoping for a breakthrough this time.

Meanwhile, another women’s singles player S. Kisona booked her spot in the tournament proper after beating Spain’s Clara Azurmendi 21-15, 21-10 in the qualifying round.

Kisona will next play India’s Rakshitha Sree for a place in the second round. In the men’s singles, Justin Hoh will also open his campaign today against Japan’s Takuma Obayashi while Cheam June Wei will meet Taiwan’s Su Liyang.",Sport,2025-02-26,327

""I want to apologise on behalf of Al-Nassr for starting the game late. This is should not happen again. Sorry,"" the 40-year-old Portugal international added.

""We started not very good, but in second half we were a little bet better. We fixed our issues and we scored two goals so we are happy.""

Ronaldo praised his teammates as they bounced back following a loss to Al-Ettifaq.

""(The comeback) should be like that. This is Al-Nassr we have to react ... We have to continue to win and let's see what's going to happen.""

Ronaldo said the team's focus is on both the SPL and AFC Champions League Elite, where they face Esteghlal Tehran in the last 16 on Monday.

""Game-by-game, we have to build again the confidence ... We have to do it again we have to win, win, win and let's see what's going to happen"".

Ronaldo leads the SPL's scoring list with 17 goals this season, one ahead of Al-Ittihad's Karim Benzema.

During a red-carpet interview at the 2025 NAACP Image Awards, Wayans said that it’s about time White Chicks had a sequel as fans continually asked for it, two decades after the first film’s release.

“Every single day, [they asked] ‘When are you doing the sequel?,’ They love that movie. You know, I think it’s time. So, you know, let’s get Scary Movie 6 done, and then we’re gonna go bring out the White Chicks 2.” he told Good Morning America.

Lithgow confirmed his casting to Screen Rant on Tuesday, Feb 25, even as he admitted that he was “afraid” to accept the role as it might define the last chapter of his career.

“Well, it came as a total surprise to me. I just got the phone call at the Sundance Film Festival for yet another film, and it was not an easy decision because it’s going to define me for the last chapter of my life, I’m afraid.

I’ll be about 87 years old at the wrap party, but I’ve said yes,” he told the outlet.

Dumbledore was previously played by the late actors Michael Gambon and Richard Harris. Lithgow is the first actor to be confirmed for the new Harry Potter series.

Lithgow is fresh from his portrayal as Cardinal Joseph Tremblay in the award-winning Vatican thriller Conclave.

He’s also known for his performances as Winston Churchill in the first season of The Crown and as Sam Burns in Terms Of Endearment.

Flick said that conceding four goals should be unacceptable for a club like Barcelona and that his side must learn how to close out games properly.

""I have warned the players not to concede any chances. I'm disappointed with the result because it was good to see how we managed to fight back after conceding two goals early and, even after we opened a 4-2 lead, we created a lot of chances... But it was all in vain because in the last few minutes we let them back into it,"" Flick told Spanish public television TVE.

""We had chances to go to the second leg with an advantage. We will have to talk a lot in the changing room about the goals we conceded... We have to correct the mistakes. The team is very young, there is a lot of room for improvement, but that is no excuse. They scored four goals against us and it's just too much for our standards.""

Flick praised Atletico's resilience and said that there were positives he could take from his side's performance, mainly in attack.

""I am frustrated but still happy with many things I saw in the game. But the conceded goals can't happen,"" Flick said.

""Atletico played very well, we faced a good and strong team that left it all out there. But I think we dominated the game for 80 minutes, but in the last few minutes we didn't defend well. I couldn't believe the fourth goal.

""At least, I think the fans enjoyed it because it was a battle. Atletico have a fantastic team. The important thing is for the team to have confidence moving forward. We have to be positive, we are not throwing in the towel and we are confident we will be able to win the second leg.""

The governing FIA urged fans to show more respect in a statement at the weekend while Verstappen's father Jos suggested the four-times world champion might not attend such an event in England in future.

Horner said Red Bull had not had any conversation with the FIA after the event and their comments reflected the body's ongoing campaign to stamp out online abuse.

Comparing the event at the O2 Arena to ""launching your away strip in a home fans' stadium"", Horner said fans would always show more support for their own teams and drivers and accepted sport was polarising.

""I guess the only disappointment that I had with it was that the reception to Max as a four-time world champion was disappointing,"" he said.

""If the launches had been in Holland, no doubt the reception would have been somewhat different.""

McLaren boss Zak Brown, whose constructors' title-winning drivers received plenty of applause on the night, said the fans were just voicing their opinion.

""I've never been to a sporting event that's been quiet, where someone's not yelling at a football player for missing a goal, or in ice hockey or baseball,"" he said.

""Sport brings out passion in fans, and they cheer and they boo. I didn't hear anything that was other than cheering and booing. I've certainly seen a lot worse on social media...

""Everyone has a favourite team, a favourite driver, a less favourite side. I just think that's sport. I didn't think there was anything visceral or violent, and you definitely see other sports that have had riots break out.

""That was fans doing what fans do, they kind of voice their opinion on who they are cheering for or not.""

Chung won in the first round of the election to lead the Korea Football Association (KFA) for the next four years.

Speaking to the press after being reelected, Chung thanked those who voted for him and said he felt a ""bigger responsibility"" and vowed to keep his promises.

""I hope the weather will be warmer and spring will come in football too,"" he said.

In November, Chung, who has led the KFA since 2013, faced calls from the sports ministry to be suspended for breaking its own rules when hiring two men's national team head coaches.

The recommendation was included in the final results of an audit probing the organisation's recruitment of Hong Myung-bo and his predecessor Jurgen Klinsmann, which sparked a public backlash amid accusations of favouritism.

A court earlier this month granted a request by the KFA to halt the execution of the ministry's demand to penalise its chief, allowing him to run for reelection, according to the Yonhap News Agency.

1566073,"Cricket-Quest for ODI runs record can keep Kohli motivated, says Ponting","(Reuters) - Virat Kohli is more than 4,000 runs adrift of Sachin Tendulkar in the list of leading one-day international scorers but former Australia captain Ricky Ponting believes the 36-year-old can still surpass the Indian maestro if he remains hungry.

Kohli went past 14,000 runs in the format with an unbeaten 100 in India's victory over Pakistan in the Champions Trophy on Sunday and only has Tendulkar (18,426) and Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara (14,234) ahead of him.

Ponting, who is fourth in the list with 13,704 runs, backed the Indian batsmen to keep adding to his tally of 14,085.

""With someone like Virat, you never write him off, because I'm sure he would be motivated by that (achieving the record),"" Ponting said on the ICC Review Podcast.

""Now that he's gone past me and only two ahead of him, I'm sure he wants to give himself the best chance to be remembered as the all-time leading run scorer in the game.

""So, as long as the hunger's there ... physically, he's probably as fit as he's ever been and works exceptionally hard on that side of his game. If the hunger's still there then I'm never going to write him off.""

Ponting said it would not be long before Kohli scores the 150 runs he needs to go past Sangakkara, suggesting he could even do so in India's next game against New Zealand on Sunday.

Catching Tendulkar, who retired from ODI cricket in 2012 aged 39, would be much more challenging but not impossible.

""It's crazy when you think about it ... how good Virat's been over such a long period of time, yet he's still 4,000 runs behind Sachin,"" Ponting added.

""It just goes to show how good Sachin was, but also his longevity in the game. How long Sachin played for and how long you're able to maintain such high levels for as a player.

""That's the one thing I've always judged excellence on, is how long you can maintain it for.""

1565989,Boxing-Eubank Jr slaps Benn with egg in press conference,"(Reuters) - Chris Eubank Jr smashed an egg into Conor Benn's face at a press conference in Manchester on Tuesday, two months before their showdown at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.

A much-hyped fight between the sons of two former British arch-rivals was called off in 2022 when Benn returned a finding for trace amounts of fertility drug clomifene.

The pair are now due to meet on April 28 in the rearranged bout.

""Apparently egg contamination was the reason for his two failed drugs tests. So I contaminated him with an egg,"" Eubank Jr posted on social media platform X.

Benn, the son of former super-middleweight world champion Nigel Benn, was cleared of intentional doping in 2023 by the World Boxing Council, which said a ""highly elevated consumption of eggs"" was a reasonable explanation for the failed tests.

A provisional suspension was then reimposed after successful appeals by UK anti-doping (UKAD) and the British Boxing Board of Control before UKAD confirmed late last year it had received the National Anti-Doping Panel's decision and that the 28-year-old's provisional suspension had been lifted.

""That's the only shot you'll land on me ... two rounds you are finished,"" Benn posted on X.

Suaalii, who made his test debut in the Wallabies' season-ending tour of Europe, missed training last week as the Waratahs had a bye in the second round.

Coach Dan McKellar downplayed his absence, saying: ""Sometimes you've got to put the Ferraris in the garage.""

But McKellar acknowledged on Wednesday that the 21-year-old fullback had been nursing a toe problem.

""We haven't got all the details yet, but hopefully that's short term,"" he told reporters.

""He pulled up sore (after round one) but recovered quite well and we thought he would be right for this week, but unfortunately he is not.""

Suaalii was a winner in his Super Rugby Pacific debut as the Waratahs clinched a last-gasp 37-36 victory over the Otago Highlanders in round one.

The Waratahs face a Drua side who are winless from two games this season.

With New Zealand already qualified for the semi-finals, selectors have the luxury of resting players for the final group match against India in Dubai on Sunday.

Batsman Ravindra sat out the Black Caps' opener against Pakistan while recovering from a blow to the head and does not want to miss another match at the ICC tournament.

""Conversations haven't really been had around that. But in a tournament like this, I guess you want to play as many games as you can,"" the 25-year-old lefthander told reporters on Wednesday.

""And the nature of my injury before is meaning I've missed some games.

""So I'll do whatever the team wants but I'd be keen to get out there and hopefully do my thing.""

Ravindra's preparations for the tournament were disrupted when he was struck on the head by the ball in a fielding mishap, forcing him to go through concussion protocols.

He scored 112 against Bangladesh on his return to the team batting at number four in place of Daryl Mitchell, who was ruled out due to illness.

Ravindra said all-rounder Mitchell was ""definitely progressing well"" on his way back to full health and the team were glad to have a couple of rest days.

“We are very, very worried for our pope,” Isabella Rossellini told reporters at the SAG Awards virtual press room. “We love this pope — Papa Francesco, Pope Francis. We wish him well. We wish him to recover.”

Actor and director Sergio Castellitto echoed his co-star’s statement by reflecting on the deep connection that many Italians feel with Pope Francis.

“For us that live in Rome, to live a few metres, a few yards from the Pope is to have a much closer relationship. We see the helicopter leaving his place: ‘Oh, is the Pope flying off today and coming back!’ So, our relationship as Italians to the Pope is much closer. I repeat, I really wish him well,” he expressed in Italian.

The Vatican said in its evening bulletin on Tuesday, Feb 25, that the pope’s condition showed “slight improvement.” He has been hospitalised since Feb. 14.

Conclave is adapted from Robert Harris’ 2016 best-selling novel of the same name, which revolves around the Catholic tradition of the papal conclave, when the papacy is vacated either because of death or retirement, and the cardinals gather inside the walls of the Vatican under a veil of secrecy to elect the new Bishop of Rome, aka the Pope.

Aside from its SAG Awards win, the papal thriller previously won four awards at the 78th British Academy Film Awards (Bafta). It also bagged the Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay. For the 97th Academy Awards, it has earned eight nominations including Best Picture.

The latest data among those in elementary through high school edged up to 527 from 513 cases in 2023, the ministry said.

The total number of people of all ages dying by suicide fell 7.2% to 20,268, sharply lower from the record high of 34,427 cases in 2003.

The number among people aged younger than 20, including those at school, also fell to 800 in 2024 from 810 in 2023, the latest data showed.

""We regard this very seriously,"" Keiichiro Tachibana, deputy chief cabinet secretary, told a regular press briefing.

""We will continue do our utmost to take measures to protect children's lives and to realise a society where no one is pressed into taking their own life.""

The health ministry was expected to issue its analysis of the data in March after more figures become available.

Japan annually sees the number of teen suicides rise at the end of every summer break in late August through early September.

This prompts the government and media to heighten public calls for struggling teens to seek help.

The exact reasons for the bulk of student suicides remain unknown.

Past analysis has shown teens contending with several pressures, including related to studies, bullying, relationships, career choices and health issues.

At the peak in 2003 the number of males killing themselves in Japan outnumbered females by almost three to one, prompting the government to take action.

This has included aggressive awareness campaigns, mental health services and efforts to improve the rigorous workplace culture.

Last year there were 13,763 male suicides, down 45 percent from 2003, while 6,505 females took their own lives, down 31%. – AFP

Meanwhile, the Bamboo Hills Residences project, also in Kuala Lumpur, that was launched last July with a projected gross development value (GDV) of RM1.4bil, has already achieved a 65% take-up rate as of last December and is expected to be completed by 2029.

Kenanga Research also favoured the property developer for its strong net cash position of RM233.7mil as of Dec 31, 2024.

“While earnings visibility remains somewhat limited, with unbilled sales at RM837.4mil, it is backed by stable rental income and rising occupancy in its office and retail spaces such as Bamboo Hills and Sphere.

“Additionally, its hospitality segment, including the Komune Living and Wellness integrated co-living and wellness hub in Kuala Lumpur, is expected to benefit from both domestic and international guests,” it added.

The research house said UOA’s core net profit of RM240.2mil for last year came in at 109% and 100% of its full-year forecast and the full-year consensus estimate, respectively.

It pointed out that the performance was due to better-than expected property sales at its Bamboo Hills Residences, while Aster Hill and Laurel Residence saw better revenue recognition.

Revenue last year increased by 37% year-on-year due to better property sales from Bamboo Hills Residences, while Aster Hill contributed strongly due to its encouraging progress completion.

The developer’s core net profit rose by 11%, driven by better rental incomes and hospitality profits.

The research house raised its earnings forecast for UOA this year by 13%, incorporating higher revenue recognition attributed to better progress on projects. It maintained its “market perform” call as UOA’s share price has risen 2.8% year-to-date.

Energy markets were disrupted by significant geopolitical events during the year, with slowing global growth and soft demand from top consumer China further exerting a downward pressure on commodity prices.

Woodside’s average realised price for its products was US$63.60 per barrel of oil equivalent, down 7% from last year.

That hurt the company’s full-year underlying net profit after tax, which fell to US$2.88bil from last year’s US$3.32bil.

It was Woodside’s smallest annual profit since 2021, though it beat the Visible Alpha consensus estimate of US$2.83bil.

On a statutory basis, full-year net profit after tax more than doubled from last year to US$3.57bil.

The company declared a final dividend of 53 US cents per share, slightly ahead of the consensus of 51 US cents apiece, but below last year’s 60 cents per share.

“The final dividend was also ahead of consensus, which the market should like today,” analysts at Citi said in a note.

Woodside maintained its financial 2025 production forecast of between 186 and 196 million barrels of oil equivalent.

“With ongoing robust LNG demand forecast for the Asia Pacific region, and near-term structural shortfalls in gas supply forecast for both the country’s east coast and Western Australian markets, Woodside will continue to be a reliable supplier of energy,” chief executive officer Meg O’Neill said.

The company also reaffirmed its capital expenditure forecast of between US$4.5bil and US$5bil, excluding its plans for the Louisiana LNG project, which it acquired in October 2024.

The Rosario Candela-designed building, completed around 1930, is about a mile north from Citadel’s offices in the ultra-modern 425 Park Ave and the proposed skyscraper at 350 Park, where Citadel and Citadel Securities will be anchor tenants.

Griffin already owns other homes in Manhattan, including a penthouse condo he bought for a record-setting US$238mil in 2019 at 220 Central Park South, along Billionaires’ Row.

Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis lived there as a child and John D. Rockefeller owned the unit that is now Schwarzman’s.

The sale was completed last week, and the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that Griffin was the buyer.

“Koch looked to sell the 18-room co-op after her husband’s 2019 death and had asked as much as US$60mil when quietly marketing it in 2022,” the Journal reported at the time.

Selangor Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Amirudin Shari introduced the Group Strategic Plan (GSB) at a press conference in Setia Alam in conjunction with MBI’s 30th anniversary Pearl Jubilee dinner on Tuesday (Feb 25).

He said the blueprint would guide MBI’s direction until 2028 and ensure the agency continued to drive the economy.

“Several strategies will be refined by MBI, including increasing revenue and profits, with a revenue target of RM8bil by 2026 and a pre-tax profit of local councils of RM1.2bil.

""In addition, a cost-saving strategy worth RM250mil by 2026 has also been planned to boost profitability,” said Amirudin.

He said that last year, Selangor recorded RM101bil in investments, with the majority—RM82bil—coming from the services sector.

“The new blueprint focuses on five main factors, namely growing income and profit, optimising its business portfolio, digital transformation and automation, strengthening its administration, and developing a high-performance talent and culture.

“The restructuring is not just for MBI’s internal structure but also for MBI and its subsidiaries. ""We are aiming for MBI to receive dividends from its subsidiaries, which will then be returned to the state government,"" he said.

Amirudin said MBI was also focusing on developing new talent.

""Prioritising talent development and a high-performance culture is crucial.

""Some of these efforts are already in place through scholarship funds for state government subsidiaries' personnel and their families.

""MBI has been implementing this initiative annually, providing continuous support.

1565455,RM6.5mil building to support S’wak kids with autism,"SIBU Autistic Association (SAA) is constructing a bigger building costing RM6.5mil to accommodate the increasing number of children with autism.

Its chairman David Ngu said the number of children diagnosed with autism in Sarawak’s central region was increasing each year.

There were just 70 in 2019 and this had gone up to 152 last year, he said.

Ngu said the current premises at Agape Centre could only accommodate up to 50 children.

“There is urgent need to have a larger place for the children,” he said during the project award and agreement signing ceremony with contractor Happiwin Development Sdn Bhd.

Ngu said the new building would be located next to Agape Centre in Jalan Alan and could accommodate 200 children.

Construction is expected to be completed in 15 months.

Ngu estimated that there were 1,000 children with autism in the central region.

“Quite a number of the children who had received early intervention can now cope very well in the community,” he said.

Ngu also expressed his appreciation to Sibu Community Service Association chairman Datuk Tiong Thai King for giving them the greenlight to occupy the land to construct the new building.

Tiong also praised SAA, which was formed in 2000, for providing early intervention programmes.

“Over the years, you have done your best to open a window for children to communicate with the world.

“Here we have witnessed children making progress little by little and overcoming communication barriers.

“Behind these miracles, there is the power of early intervention,” he said.

SAA, he said, not only provided therapeutic courses, but also offered mutual assistance network for parents, organised workshops on home intervention skills and even sought government support for special families.

“The new building will have modern facilities such as special classrooms, treatment rooms and entertainment areas, which can greatly improve the level and quality of the association’s services and further benefit the children,” added Tiong.",Metro,2025-02-26,316

Bukit Assek assemblyman Joseph Chieng said this would ensure life-saving interventions are both accessible and effective when needed.

Chieng said this in response to Deputy Premier Datuk Dr Sim Kui Hian’s proposal to amend Sarawak Building Ordinance 1994, making AEDs mandatory in some locations.

“Given Sarawak’s high prevalence of heart disease, I fully support this proposal and believe MRCS Sibu can play a crucial role in its implementation,” Chieng said during the society’s appreciation dinner.

He added that it was not enough just to have AEDs and regulations.

“If no one knows how to use the equipment, its presence cannot save lives.

“This is why Sibu branch must take the lead in providing AED training to local communities.”

Separately, Chieng said the branch faced challenges in recruiting members and volunteers.

He said sustaining financial stability was also a pressing issue as the organisation depended on public support and sponsorships to continue its work.

“Raising awareness about the importance of humanitarian efforts requires consistent engagement and education of the community,” he added.

Chieng commended members, volunteers and staff of the Sibu branch for their dedication and tireless service.

“From disaster response and health campaigns to first-aid training and humanitarian outreach, your contributions reflect the core values of the Red Crescent movement: humanity, impartiality and voluntary service.

“These values remind us of the importance of coming together as a community to support one another, especially in challenging times,” Chieng added.

The fundraising campaign, organised for Lai Zheng Wei by the Community Care Enrichment Programme (CCEP) Foundation, surpassed its RM100,000 goal, raising RM105,000 within 48 hours.

Lai, a restaurant worker in Ipoh, is expected to undergo surgery next month.

Foundation chief executive officer Yvonne Yee said the campaign, featured on Feb 20 in The Star, touched hearts and drew generous contributions from readers nationwide.

“Within just 48 hours of the news publication, an outpouring of support enabled the foundation to raise the necessary funds for Lai’s urgent surgery.

“We want to express our deepest gratitude to every donor whose swift response made this life-changing moment possible,” she said in a statement.

“We are truly humbled by the generosity of our supporters,” she said, adding that Lai’s family had been informed about the successful campaign.

Yee said the public’s generosity and swift action served as a powerful reminder of what can be achieved when communities unite with empathy and love.

Kampar-born Lai has struggled with seizures since he was five years old.

His condition recently worsened, prompting his family and the CCEP to launch an urgent appeal to raise RM100,000 for his stereo-­electroencephalography surgery.

This minimally invasive procedure maps the brain’s epileptic regions, minimising the need for open brain surgery.

Yee said the CCEP had contacted Lai’s doctor at Universiti Malaya Medical Centre, to expedite the surgery.

“The urgency is underscored by a severe seizure that Lai experienced during Chinese New Year.

“This episode, marked by significant brain hypoxia that led to a temporary loss of consciousness, left family members frightened and overwhelmed,” she said.

1566129,Kremlin says Russia and US are preparing more talks,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Wednesday that preparations were being made for expert-level talks between Russia and the United States to follow up on a high-level meeting last week and an earlier call between presidents Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov reiterated that there was an understanding that Trump and Putin should meet in person after thorough preparation, but said there were no details yet on when and where this would happen.

He said the two leaders could speak again by phone if needed, but there were no current plans for this.

""Contacts are being prepared at the expert level through the ministries of foreign affairs,"" Peskov said, without providing any further details.

Trump has expressed a desire to bring about a ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war as soon as possible. His rapid moves to repair relations with Moscow, reversing the policy of the previous administration of Joe Biden, have raised fears in Kyiv and among its European allies that they could be sidelined.

Putin this week tempered expectations for a quick deal on Ukraine, saying that U.S.-Russia contacts would initially focus on repairing trust between Moscow and Washington.

Peskov declined to comment on a reported minerals agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine that Trump has said would allow the U.S. taxpayer to recoup money that Washington has provided to Ukraine in the course of the war.

The Kremlin spokesman noted reports that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy would visit Trump on Friday.

""Whether it will be (to sign) the aforementioned agreement or something else, we'll see. There have been no official statements on this matter yet,"" he said.

A source familiar with the contents of the draft agreement told Reuters on Tuesday that it does not specify any U.S. security guarantees or continued flow of weapons, but says that the United States wants Ukraine to be “free, sovereign and secure.”

1566263,Romanian prosecutors question far-right frontrunner in presidential election probe,"BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romanian prosecutors summoned the frontrunner in last year's cancelled presidential election, far-right candidate Calin Georgescu, for questioning on Wednesday as part of their wider investigation into the vote, judicial sources said.

The presidential ballot was voided in December on account of suspected Russian interference in favour of Georgescu, a strong critic of NATO and Western support for Ukraine. Moscow denied the accusations of meddling in the vote.

Prosecutors launched a criminal investigation following the cancellation amid accusations of wrongdoing ranging from campaign funding fraud and promoting anti-Semitism and hate speech to acts against the constitutional order.

Georgescu is not currently considered a suspect.

Prosecutors also said on Wednesday they had raided 47 addresses of people and associations connected to Georgescu. Earlier this month they raided the home of his campaign manager.

Georgescu accused authorities of behaviour reminiscent of Romania's communist past.

""The communist Bolshevik system is continuing its heinous abuse,"" Georgescu said on his Facebook account on Wednesday.

""They are looking to invent evidence to justify stealing the election and to do anything in their efforts to block a new candidacy from me.""

His communications team said in a post on social media that authorities had hauled Georgescu in for questioning on the day he had intended to submit his candidacy for a rerun of the presidential election set for May.

""Where is democracy now, where are the partners who should defend democracy?"" the post read.

Georgescu, who has praised Romania's 1930s fascist leaders and expressed admiration for both U.S. President Donald Trump and Russia's President Vladimir Putin, remains voters' top choice in opinion polls ahead of the May rerun, although it remains unclear whether he will be allowed to run.

Members of U.S. President Donald Trump's administration have sharply criticised Romania for annulling its election. U.S. Vice President JD Vance said the cancellation meant Romania does not share American values, while billionaire Elon Musk labelled the chief judge of the top court that annulled the vote a ""tyrant"".

""Our support for Ukraine is ironclad. We want to see a just and enduring peace in line with the U.N. charter,"" Britain's Ambassador to the U.N. and World Trade Organization, Simon Manley, said.

""Ukraine has to be at the negotiating table,"" said Manley, who walked out of the speech as it started.

""If we let slide what happened with Ukraine without reacting...we would open the door to a disintegration of fundamental principles on which the U.N. was founded,"" France's Ambassador Jerome Bonnafont said.

Washington's seat at the Human Rights Council was empty after U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to quit the body, which is the only intergovernmental organisation that protects human rights.

In his speech to the council, Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Vershinin accused Ukraine of a ""flagrant violation of fundamental human rights"", accusing it of Russophobia.

""Securing human rights and freedoms is incompatible with double standards,"" Vershinin added.

Ukraine's representative criticised Russia for defying international law.

""The aggressor should be punished, aggression should not be rewarded,"" Ukraine's Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mariana Betsa, told the council.

After her speech, she told Reuters there should be no bilateral talks with Russia.

""The EU should be present and the U.S. Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine,"" she said, adding Ukraine needs clear security guarantees.

The U.N. Security Council on Monday adopted a U.S.-drafted resolution that takes a neutral stance on the conflict, reflecting Trump's upending of U.S. policy on Ukraine and his more conciliatory stance towards Russia.

The contract, awarded to NexG’s wholly-owned subsidiary NexG Technologies Sdn Bhd, for the development of an unmanned aircraft system traffic management system, reinforced the group’s strategic push into technology and security solutions, setting the stage for future growth opportunities.

BIMB Research viewed the contract win positively, noting that it aligns with NexG’s strategic goal of diversifying into new business segments.

However, BIMB Research noted that the contract’s relatively modest value might not significantly impact NexG’s near-term earnings.

“Though we remain upbeat on NexG’s growth prospects, we do not foresee a material impact on earnings in the near term, given the relatively modest contract value,” the research house stated in its report yesterday.

BIMB Research maintained its “buy” recommendation on NexG with an unchanged target price of 45 sen, based on a price-to-earnings ratio of 18 times, applied to the forecast earnings per share of 2.5 sen for the financial year ending March 31, 2026.

It noted that NexG warranted a premium valuation due to its market leadership in secure identification solutions, a solid order book of RM400mil, promising prospects for overseas expansion and ongoing diversification initiatives.

1565654,US judge blocks Trump's indefinite suspension of refugee resettlement program,"(Reuters) -A federal judge on Tuesday blocked President Donald Trump's effort to indefinitely suspend the U.S. refugee resettlement program, saying the Republican had exceeded his executive authority by abruptly shutting down the program.

U.S. District Judge Jamal Whitehead in Seattle, in ruling for a coalition of U.S. refugee backers who sued to challenge Trump's action, acknowledged that the president had substantial discretion under federal law to suspend refugee admissions.

""But that authority is not limitless,"" he said during a court hearing. ""I cannot ignore Congress's detailed framework for refugee admissions and the limits it places on the president's ability to suspend the same.""

The judge, an appointee of Democratic former President Joe Biden, said a preliminary injunction was warranted given the likelihood of ""irreparable harms, including refugees stranded after selling their possessions, agencies laying off hundreds of staff, and family reunifications suspended indefinitely.""

Trump, a Republican, immediately paused refugee resettlement after taking office on January 20, saying the program must ensure that refugees admitted to the U.S. ""appropriately assimilate"" and that taxpayer resources are not wasted.

He called for the secretaries of Homeland Security and State to submit a report within 90 days to determine if it should be restarted.

The sudden shutdown meant refugees across the globe had their scheduled travel to the U.S. canceled, including 1,660 Afghans cleared to resettle. Days later, funds for U.S. groups that assist refugees already in the country were frozen as part of a larger pause on foreign aid.

The lawsuit was brought by nine refugees and U.S.-based family members, including a family from the Democratic Republic of the Congo that was approved to travel to the U.S. on January 22 but had their travel canceled.

The family, which resides in Nairobi, sold all of their belongings except for what could fit in their checked luggage and gave up the lease on their home, the complaint said.

Trump added it is possible Russian oligarchs could qualify for the gold cards, when asked by a journalist if those people would be eligible. ""Yeah, possibly. Hey. I know some Russian oligarchs that are very nice people,"" he said.

The EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program, administered by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, was created by Congress in 1990 to ""stimulate the U.S. economy through job creation and capital investment by foreign investors,"" according to the USCIS website.

""The EB-5 program ... it was full of nonsense, make believe and fraud, and it was a way to get a green card that was low price. So the president said, rather than having this sort of ridiculous EB-5 program, we're going to end the EB-5 program. We're going to replace it with the Trump gold card,"" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told reporters on Tuesday.

1565909,North Korea's Kim calls for building modern army to brace for war,"SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for building a strong, modern army to cope with any war during a visit to a military academy, state media KCNA said on Wednesday.

Kim's trip to the Kang Kon Military Academy comes after North Korea has sent thousands of troops to Russia to support its war against Ukraine. This week Kim also visited the Kim Il Sung University of Politics, another elite cadre training institution, calling for military loyalty and sacrifice.

South Korea's intelligence agency has said Kim's previous inspections of military units and training might be part of preparations for an additional dispatch of soldiers to Russia.

During the latest visit to the military academy, Kim criticised the school's poor management and operation of educational facilities, saying it failed to meet the ruling party's pursuit of ""modernity and advanced character"" in building a powerful army, KCNA said.

He laid out tasks to refurbish the facilities and intensify education focusing on practice so that the students would learn about the ""actual experiences of modern warfare"", and to master advanced weapons and technical equipment, it said.

""The present international situation, in which the aggressive and bellicose nature of the imperialists is most openly expressed in history and war and bloodshed become commonplaces, requires the armed forces ... to perfectly cope with a war,"" Kim said, according to KCNA. South Korean officials have warned that North Korea could benefit from supplying weapons and troops to fight in Russia by gaining experience and insight from operating on a modern battlefield.

Kyiv has said North Korean forces have suffered heavy casualties in Russia, with more than 3,000 soldiers killed or wounded by early January this year.

All of this year's more than 200 nominees, from actors to directors, producers, sound editors, makeup artists and others, were invited to the event at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures.

Chalamet, nominated for his portrayal of musician Bob Dylan in ""A Complete Unknown,"" arrived in all black and clipped his name tag to his front pants pocket. The actor later chatted at the bar with his competitor, ""The Brutalist"" star Adrien Brody.

""Wicked"" actress Grande wore a black dress with pink feathers, a favorite color of her character Galinda in the prequel to ""The Wizard of Oz."" Moore, nominated for her role as a fading celebrity in ""The Substance,"" chose a white pant suit.

Other attendees included Sebastian Stan, Cynthia Erivo, Isabella Rossellini, Fernanda Torres, Edward Norton, Zoe Saldana, Colman Domingo and Jeremy Strong.

Before being seated for dinner, the nominees gathered for the annual group photo. The picture normally is taken at a nominees' luncheon, but that event was canceled this year when wildfires hit Los Angeles and disrupted Hollywood's awards season.

The Academy Awards show on Sunday will offer ""community and an atmosphere of support"" for people recovering from the fires while also celebrating the top performances in film, Academy President Janet Yang told the nominees at the dinner.

""We simply must honor the talent - your talents - this year, as we have every year, as part of a tradition that is now 97 years old,"" Yang said. ""We must, because it brings so much joy to people all over the world.""

“The Trump administration will enforce all our immigration laws — we will not pick and choose which laws we will enforce,"" a department spokesperson said. ""We must know who is in our country for the safety and security of our homeland and all Americans.”

All immigrants over the age of 14 who were not fingerprinted or registered when applying for a U.S. visa and who remain in the United States for 30 days or longer are required to register and be fingerprinted, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website where immigrants can register.

Once an immigrant has registered and been fingerprinted, the Department of Homeland Security will issue evidence of registration, which must be carried by immigrants over the age of 18 at all times, according to the website.

On his return to office last month, President Donald Trump declared illegal immigration at the Mexico border a national emergency and directed the department to ensure that immigrants register with the federal government.

The administration has sought to shut down the previous Biden administration's CBP One entry program, which had allowed hundreds of thousands of migrants to enter the U.S. legally by scheduling an appointment on an app.

Ali Abbasi, a Danish-Iranian filmmaker, said on X that he was ""truly sorry"" for his behaviour at a party that followed the Golden Globes awards ceremony in Los Angeles in January.

Abbasi's biopic The Apprentice, released weeks before last year's US election, caused a stir with its unflattering representation of Trump, portraying him suffering erectile dysfunction and undergoing surgery for hair loss.

""I fully understand that my action made someone uncomfortable, regardless of my intent, and for that I am truly sorry,"" Abbasi wrote on social media of the groping incident.

He said that he ""made an over-familiar gesture - a slap on the rear"" to a male acquaintance with whom he considered he had a friendly relationship, but said it was ""intended as playful and not in any sexual way whatsoever.""

""I quickly realised I had misjudged the situation. I apologised to him on the spot, and the following day I made sure my apology was reiterated through my representatives,"" Abbasi said.

The director refuted an account in The Hollywood Reporter that his talent agency, Creative Artists Agency (CAA), had dropped him due to the allegation against him.

""My decision to part ways was a long term career decision that was not shaped by short term motivations,"" he said.

The Apprentice is competing for Oscars in the categories of Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor.

It was released in US cinemas by indie studio Briarcliff Entertainment, as no major Hollywood studios were willing to risk distributing the polarising movie.

Home Affairs and Law Minister K Shanmugam and Manpower Minister Tan See Leng had threatened legal action in December, saying at the time a Bloomberg report on Singapore real estate that mentioned them by name was libellous.

Bloomberg declined to comment on the lawsuits on Wednesday. The lawsuits will be heard at the Supreme Court on March 3.

Singapore's government ordered Bloomberg in December to issue a ""correction direction"" on the report, under the country's Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act.

The media company complied and updated the original story with a notice saying the correction direction had been published ""under threat of sanction"" and it stood by its reporting.

Senior figures in the ruling People's Action Party, including former Prime Ministers Lee Kuan Yew and Lee Hsien Loong, have filed successful defamation lawsuits against media and political opponents.

Shanmugam and Tan are represented by lawyer Davinder Singh, a former ruling party parliamentarian who has represented former premiers in defamation suits.

1565649,"It's time to seize Russian assets, not just freeze them, says UK's Lammy","LONDON (Reuters) - Europe should move from freezing Russian assets to seizing them, British foreign minister David Lammy said on Tuesday, hardening Britain's position on how the West should use bonds and other securities frozen since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

After Russian President Vladimir Putin sent troops into Ukraine in 2022, the United States and its allies prohibited transactions with Russia's central bank and finance ministry, blocking $300-$350 billion of sovereign Russian assets.

They are mostly European, U.S. and British government bonds held in a European securities depository.

European leaders want to use those assets to help rebuild Ukraine, but have yet to reach an agreement on how to avoid legal challenges or setting a problematic international precedent, with several options under consideration.

""Europe has to act quickly, and I believe we should move from freezing assets to seizing assets,"" Lammy told parliament when asked if he would support emergency legislation to seize and repurpose the assets to support Ukraine.

""It's not an issue on which any government can act alone. We must act with European allies.""

Lammy did not elaborate on exactly how he wanted to deal with those assets.

In a January debate in parliament on what to do with the frozen assets, foreign office minister for Europe, Stephen Doughty, only went as far as to say Britain was considering ""all lawful measures that we can possibly take to ensure that Ukraine gets the support it needs"".

The European Union estimates that some 210 billion euros ($220.58 billion) of the frozen money is held in the bloc, mainly in Euroclear, a Brussels-based securities depository.

Some Western officials, especially in the German government and the European Central Bank, have been reluctant to simply confiscate sovereign reserves, warning that such a move could face legal challenges and undermine the euro as a reserve currency.

1562811,Work from home? How to go easy on back and not be hard on your wallet,"If you work from home and want to go easy on your back, it needn't be hard on your wallet, an expert says. Don't have an ergonomic office chair at your desk, for example? You can support your lumbar spine with a pillow.

Another back-friendly measure is to regularly change your position while working, says Susanne Weber, an ergonomics advisor with the Campaign for Healthier Backs (AGR), a German association that promotes research and public information on back-pain prevention.

Using an inflatable balance cushion, also known as a wobble cushion, promotes ""active (or ""dynamic"") sitting,"" as it engages core muscles including your back. And a flexible, dynamic stool that you can shove under your desk makes regular position changes easier too, points out Weber.

If possible, working now and then while standing is also good for your back. And you don't necessarily need an electrically height-adjustable desk - a standing desk converter placed on your desktop is a cheaper alternative.

A bookshelf, sideboard or lectern can be converted into a standing desk as well, according to Weber.

To avoid neck stiffness, it's important that your computer monitor be at the proper height, namely slightly below eye level. If you work with a laptop, a laptop stand can do the trick. Using a stack of books as a stand is a cheaper makeshift solution, notes Weber.

She also advises using an external keyboard and mouse.

Does your workplace have limited space? In regard to your desk, Weber says, sufficient depth - at least 80 centimetres - is more important than width. This will allow you to maintain an arm's length between your eyes and the computer monitor and rest your forearms on the desk, relieving your shoulders.

If your desk is too narrow, a special armrest for desks can increase the support surface. – dpa",Lifestyle,2025-02-25,304

Video published by TMZ shows the pop star, 30, heading to his car after dining at LA’s Beverly Glen Deli when a photographer – not one from the outlet – shouts out a “thank you” to Bieber.

“Yo, why do you thank me?” the Grammy winner snapped. “That’s disrespectful when you thank me, ’cause I’m not asking you to be here. You know what I mean?”

Though the paparazzo explained he was just expressing gratitude for everything Bieber does “for us,” the singer doubled down, saying he doesn’t want the photographer to be there in the first place.

“Just take your pictures and let me do my thing,” he continued. “I don’t want you to be here. … Don’t thank me for everything.”

It wasn’t the first time the Sorry crooner has confronted onlookers for behavior he deemed unacceptable.

In early August, he was filmed yelling at a group of teenagers who were seemingly harassing him and Hailey as they met for lunch at the Waldorf Astoria in Beverly Hills. Hailey was pregnant at the time and mere weeks away from giving birth.

On Aug 23, the couple announced they’d welcomed their first child, baby boy Jack Blues.

Despite their pregnancy seeming to quiet speculation the Biebers were headed for divorce, rumours picked up again not long after Jack was born.

The chatter continued as recently as this week after Justin posted a cryptic Instagram Story about maturing and “letting go.”

“Changing is about letting go! Not trying harder!” he wrote in part on Thursday (Feb 20). “Today I’m letting go and remembering the weight isn’t on me to change. The weight is on God.”

The Navitas Spa Sarnic is operated by the Hagia Sofia Mansions Istanbul hotel, which is part of Hilton’s luxury Curio Collection that currently offers top-price suites.

The hotel, just a short walk from the Hagia Sofia, a Unesco World Heritage site, modified the ancient structure to include a jacuzzi-style swimming pool, sauna and massage rooms and a Turkish hammam.

The revelations about the work sparked an online backlash on social media and eventually local officials took action.

“The swimming and spa centre near the Hagia Sophia mosque ... was sealed off by teams from the Fatih municipality in line with a decision by its preservation committee,” a municipal official said.

The culture and tourism ministry also said it had lodged a complaint in 2023 about “unauthorised practices” concerning the spa.

The hotel is in the Sultanahmet neighbourhood, known for the Grand Bazaar, the Blue Mosque with its iconic minarets and the Hagia Sophia.

“Our spa offers a Turkish Bath and a restored 1,500-year-old cistern,” the hotel website says, showing photos of a tastefully-lit brick-lined underground pool with bubbling turquoise waters.

The municipality said the cistern was owned by Dorak, a holding company with tourism assets across Turkiye.

Around 70 women signed the letter which was first published on Wednesday in response to a newspaper interview with Jason Atherton in which the Michelin-starred male chef claimed he had ""not seen"" sexism in British kitchens.

The female chefs said the restaurant industry was ""systematically flawed"" and criticised a ""pitiful representation of women"" at the Michelin Guide UK awards presented earlier this month.

""Sexism has been and remains a pervasive issue in our industry, shaping the culture of our kitchens in ways that diminish the potential and contributions of countless talented women,"" the letter said.

""We need you to know that we are tired. Exhausted by an industry so systematically flawed that we struggle to see ourselves within it.""

The chefs highlighted ""inappropriate comments and behaviours"" as well as ""unequal opportunities for advancement,"" noting that ""over the last four years only two women have been awarded Michelin stars"" in the UK.

About a quarter of the country's 203,700 chefs are women, according to the latest Office for National Statistics figures.

The letter's signatories stressed it was important to address a lack of diversity in the industry, saying ""the only way to do this is by rectifying the lack of women and people of colour in leadership roles"".

Those who signed the letter included chef Sally Abe of London's The Pem and Helen Graham, former executive chef at Middle Eastern restaurant Bubala, according to The Times said.

""The industry is turning a blind eye to behaviour which is so endemic that it's not recognised as sexism, and it gets left unchecked,"" Graham told the paper.

The Michelin Guide told AFP in a statement that it condemned all acts of violence and harassment. But it acknowledged that ""gender stereotypes were deeply seated"" in the industry, which was ""unfortunately reflected"" in their selections.

""A chef's gender has never been and will never be a criteria for our selections,"" it said, adding that Michelin was ""conscious of its responsibility"" to promote diversity. – AFP",Lifestyle,2025-02-25,356

It was a chance to reconnect with his father, James, 58, through a shared passion that had shaped their lives for decades.

For Joshua, this was not a spur-of-the-moment idea. Music had always been their common language.

Growing up, his father filled car rides with the sounds of Blink-182, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Muse, and, of course, Green Day.

""He also loved playing Boney M and Bob Marley. We’d listen to radio together every time he drove me to school, tuition or organ classes,"" Joshua told Sinar Daily.

James, now retired, has an unwavering love for music. His hobby room is packed with CDs and cassettes, a nostalgic tribute to his punk rock roots.

""My dad’s favourite Green Day songs are Good Riddance (Time of Your Life) and Wake Me Up When September Ends. Mine are American Idiot and Boulevard Of Broken Dreams,"" he shared.

The concert, according to the duo, was an unforgettable experience.

""It was one of the best concerts I’ve ever attended. The energy was incredible, and they played all our favourite songs. Both of us had the time of our lives,” Joshua said.

Other netizens also called for a boycott of the company due to Musk's ties to and support of US President Donald Trump, to whom he acts as a senior advisor.

Tesla has also faced calls for boycotts in other countries including Poland where a government ministry said ""no normal Poles should buy a Tesla anymore"" after Musk made an appearance at a far-right political rally in Germany.

On its home turf, the EV maker is also contending with a burgeoning ‘Tesla Takedown’ movement, with supporters mobilising for street protests and urging fellow Americans to sell their Tesla cars and Tesla stock – all in an attempt to dent the company’s share price and hopefully hit Musk in his wallet.

Selangor local government and tourism committee chairman Datuk Ng Suee Lim said that MPS was expected to see an additional RM26mil in revenue due to this year's assessment tax revision.

As a result, he said MPS has outlined short, medium, and long-term plans to enhance its services.

“Other immediate efforts include better management of stray dogs.

“A total of 147 neighbourhood signages will also be replaced in phases over the next two years.

“Furthermore, 46 new business activities will be added to the list of 23 activities that can receive immediate licences.

“The installation of 50 closed-circuit television cameras will also take place at crime and illegal dumping hotspots,” he said in response to questions from Chua Wei Kiat (PH-Rawang) on MPS' plans to utilise the increased revenue, during the Selangor State Assembly sitting at Bangunan Dewan Negeri Selangor in Shah Alam.

Regarding the medium-term plan, Ng said MPS planned to upgrade all its sports facilities, with at least one being upgraded per year.

1564748,All eyes on Justin as he navigates tricky path in German Open,"PETALING JAYA: Shuttler Justin Hoh faces a tough test in the German Open which starts today in Mulheim.

All eyes will be on world No. 51 Justin in the tournament as he is the highest ranked Malaysian in the men’s singles in the absence of world No. 7 Lee Zii Jia and Leong Jun Hao (No. 27).

The 20-year-old has a tricky opening match against Japan’s world No. 43 Takuma Obayashi.

Despite holding a slight advantage over Obayashi after beating the latter in their only meeting so far in the 2023 Osaka International Challenge, Justin needs to be wary of the Japanese, who has improved since then and defeated the higher ranked Jun Hao thrice in their past four encounters.

If Justin can upstage the 25-year-old, he will likely have another difficult challenge in the second round against Thailand Masters champion Jason Teh from Singapore.

Singles head coach Kenneth Jonassen is keen to see how his charge fares in Germany and in the Orleans Masters (March 4-9) in France and Swiss Open (March 18-23) in Basel.

“Justin has had solid preparations. The German Open and two other World Tour Super 300 competitions will be another good opportunity for him to learn and develop,” said Jonassen.

“He will face higher ranked and more experienced players from the first day and I’m looking forward to seeing how he will adapt to their style of play but at the same time try to dictate his own playing style.”

Justin will be out to do better after going down to Indonesia’s Mohd Zaki Ubaidillah in the Thailand Masters first round.

The youngster’s best performance in a Super 300 event came in the Taiwan Open last September where he made it into the quarter-finals.

Meanwhile, Malaysia will also be represented in the men’s singles in Germany by independent player Cheam June Wei, who will play Taiwan’s Su Liyang in the first round.

1564745,Young Jimmy ready to play student when he partners veteran Pei Jing,"PETALING JAYA: Changing events can be daunting but independent doubles shuttler Jimmy Wong is excited by the challenge.

Jimmy, who previously played in the men’s doubles, is set to switch to the mixed doubles and combine with the more experienced Lai Pei Jing.

The 32-year-old Pei Jing will be ending her partnership with Tan Kian Meng, 30, after the All-England from March 11-16 in Birmingham.

Jimmy, who is 10 years younger than Pei Jing, hopes to learn from the latter and adapt well in the mixed doubles.

“Playing in mixed doubles is quite challenging as the game style is different from men’s doubles and I need to learn from Pei Jing and adapt,” said Jimmy.

“There’s definitely pressure on me because she’s been playing at the top level while I have not but I’m excited as well.

“I have never won a senior title before this, so I hope to end my drought with Pei Jing.”

In the men’s doubles, Jimmy’s best achievement was finishing runners-up with Lwi Shenghao in the Austrian and Slovenian Opens in 2023.

Jimmy, who is from Kajang, is keen to continue reviving his career after he was dropped by the Badminton Association of Malaysia (BAM) in 2022.

“After I was dropped from BAM, it was not easy for me to continue my career as I felt quite lost,” said Jimmy.

“Thankfully, my parents kept supporting me and that’s the reason I rediscovered my fight to continue playing badminton.”

Jimmy is also inspired by Chinese men’s doubles great Fu Haifeng and hopes to play in the Olympics one day just like his idol.

Haifeng, who was known for his powerful smashes, captured two golds in the Olympics with Cai Yun (2012 London) and Zhang Nan (2016 Rio de Janeiro).

“I loved watching Haifeng play when I was growing up. His attacking game is very good and he is so fierce on court,” said Jimmy.

Italian 18-year-old Kimi Antonelli has replaced Hamilton, now 40 and at Ferrari, in the lineup alongside Britain's George Russell and experienced reserve and former Mercedes racer Valtteri Bottas.

""We open an exciting new era in the story of our team and Mercedes-AMG motorsport in 2025. We are building on the incredible legacy of our heritage, and we can’t wait to go racing,"" declared team boss Toto Wolff.

""We have made gains in the off-season, but we will only know where we stand come the first race in Australia.""

Wolff said Russell, the 'senior driver' starting his seventh season in the sport, would help lead the team forward while Antonelli faced a rookie year in which ""there will inevitably be ups and downs.""

Mercedes, winners of a record eight constructors' championships in a row between 2014 and 2021, finished fourth last year.

Technical director James Allison said that while stable rules on the chassis side made big gains in lap time harder to find, ""we've been concentrating on making improvements in the areas that held us back last year.

""Our primary focus has been on dialling out the W15's slight reluctance to turn in slow corners, along with the imbalance in tyre temperatures that made the car inconsistent from session to session.

""We are pleased with our progress over the winter and we're looking forward to finding out where we stack up against everyone else.""

Allison expected to see multiple winners this season, possibly more than the four teams and seven drivers that won last year.

The season starts in Australia on March 16 with Mercedes-powered McLaren seeking to defend their constructors' title while Red Bull's Max Verstappen chases a fifth drivers' crown in a row.

Liverpool are on 64 points from 27 matches, with second-placed Arsenal, who have played a game less, on 53 points after Saturday's 1-0 home loss to West Ham United.

""In every other league, having a lead like this would be very comfortable, except for this one,"" Slot told reporters on Sunday.

Every game presented the potential for a slip-up, he said, pointing to Liverpool's difficult 2-1 home win against relegation-threatened Wolverhampton Wanderers last week.

""We are in a good position but we also know how hard it is to play against Wolves,"" he added.

Slot expects another tough game on Wednesday against fifth-placed Newcastle United, who drew with Liverpool in December and are coming off a 4-3 win over Nottingham Forest.

""Now we play Newcastle, we played 3-3 over there, which in my opinion was also a good result ... but we also experienced how difficult that one is,"" he said.

""We work every single day to achieve this and it is three months of very hard work to maintain this. There is no secret. We are 11 points clear but Arsenal has one game in hand.”

A five-week stretch includes a two-legged clash against Real in the last 16 of Europe's elite club competition and another meeting with Barca in LaLiga, with Atletico trailing the two giants by a point at the top of the table in a heated title run.

""The key, the only way, is to look at each day match-by-match,"" Simeone told a press conference on Monday.

""We are excited, we want to compete, looking forward to facing each game in the best way possible and to achieve that we are focused solely on tomorrow's game.

""It's a very important match, but it doesn't end tomorrow, it's divided into two stages, one on their home court and one on ours. And we'll take the game where we think we can hurt them.""

The return leg is on April 2 at the Metropolitano.

Atletico will tackle Barca on Wednesday two months after their last visit in late December saw them fight back to beat Hansi Flick's side 2-1 in a thrilling LaLiga encounter.

Simeone said his side are ready to suffer in what he expects will be a battle against LaLiga's leaders.

""When you face big teams you know you have to be prepared to resist, to endure suffering,"" Simeone said.

""There will be good moments for each side and you need to take advantage of those. It happened in the 1-1 draw against Real Madrid, where there were moments when they were better than us and the other way around.

Rublev has struggled to keep his emotions in check at times during matches and his outbursts have overshadowed his game, but the 27-year-old Russian showed his best side with a run to the Doha title last week.

Rublev is back in Dubai this week where he was defaulted in a match last season after a Russian-speaking official said he uttered an obscenity while screaming at a line judge.

Rublev said he had moved on from that incident and other issues that had been dragging him down.

""I was in a loop, lost with myself for a couple of years of, I don't know, not finding the way, not understanding what to do, what for,"" Rublev told The National newspaper.

""It sounds a bit maybe dramatic or whatever, like what's the reason or purpose to live or stuff like that.

""It's one thing when it's happening one month, two months, three months. Maybe you still have patience ... When it's coming for many years, you can't take it anymore.""

Rublev said he took anti-depressants for a year but stopped when they did not help him anymore.

Things began to change last July after speaking with his compatriot Safin, who retired in 2009. Former world number one Safin was no stranger to outbursts having broken dozens of rackets on court during his career.

""He made me understand myself,"" Rublev added.

""That was a bit of a restart from the bottom. I was able little by little to start to move in a better direction.

""I'm not happy. I'm not in a good or bad place, but I'm not feeling any more stress, I'm not feeling anxious, I'm not having depression. I'm just neutral. At least I found a base. That's a beginning.""

England lost their opening game to Australia by five wickets on Saturday after setting the 50-overs world champions a target of 352 but former test skipper Root said Buttler was doing everything a good captain should.

""He's doing so much right on the field, making good decisions and creating a really good environment for us to thrive in,"" Root, who scored 68 against Australia in Lahore, told British media on Monday.

""He's a brilliant leader. He's the best white-ball player we've ever produced and he's got the full support of everyone within our dressing room to keep doing and keep bringing everything that he's brought so far to this team.""

Wicketkeeper Buttler assumed the captaincy after Eoin Morgan retired in June 2022 and led England to their second 20-overs World Cup title later that year.

England's performances have dipped since then, however, with the side failing to defend their T20 and 50-overs World Cup titles.

They also face an early exit from the Champions Trophy unless they quickly turn things around, starting with their game against Afghanistan on Wednesday.

Ravindra was rested for New Zealand's opening victory over Pakistan after taking a blow to his forehead in a tri-series match in Lahore earlier this month but returned in place of the ill Daryl Mitchell in Rawalpindi.

Coming in to bat at number four for the first time in a one-day international with the Black Caps 15-2 inside four overs, Ravindra forged fine partnerships with Devon Conway and Latham to help his team chase down 237 runs with 23 balls to spare.

""A slightly different role to what he's been used to,"" Latham said of Ravindra's place in the batting order.

""The way he came in with us under a little bit of pressure, losing two early wickets ... for him to absorb a little bit of pressure and then put the pressure back on them. He played fantastically well.

""It just shows the talent he's got and the head on his shoulders to not play for a couple of weeks and then come out and play an innings like that. He was outstanding.""

It was Ravindra's fourth ODI century and the Wellington batsman said he was happy to be playing again having come through concussion protocols after being left bloodied by the blow to his head while fielding.

""Definitely a freak accident, things like that don't really happen too often, I'm very grateful to have a great support crew around me,"" Ravindra said. ""I've been able to come out of it reasonably well.

""It's obviously been interesting dealing with the return to play protocols and stuff ... it was cool to come back and really enjoy my cricket again after that weird moment.""

The 33-year-old, who played in South Africa’s World Cup winning teams in Japan in 2019 and France in 2023 and earned 138 caps for the Springboks, sustained the neck injury playing in a Currie Cup match for Western Province last year.

“After undergoing initial conservative therapy, the decision was taken to have stabilising surgery. Following an extensive rehabilitation process he has been left with significantly reduced rotation of his neck and the advice from a specialist neurosurgeon was that there would be a high risk of another injury should he continue playing,” the club said a statement.

Kitshoff was first called into the Stormers squad as an 18-year-old, requiring special permission to train with the seniors at such a young age, debuting in 2011 and winning a first Springbok cap in 2016.

His distinctive red hair made him a standout on the pitch.

Light rain through the day left pools of water on the covers and the outfield, making the prospect of play impossible when the game was called off just after 1200 GMT.

1565347,Soccer-'Over my dead body': Arsenal's Arteta vows not to give up on title race,"(Reuters) - Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said his side will not give up on the Premier League title race despite slipping further behind leaders Liverpool after Saturday's loss to West Ham United, insisting the team have done well despite injuries and setbacks.

""We're not going to stop. Over my dead body,"" Arteta told reporters on Tuesday ahead of their midweek trip to third-placed Nottingham Forest.

Liverpool are 11 points above Arsenal, who have a game in hand.

With forwards Gabriel Jesus and Kai Havertz out for the season and wingers Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli also sidelined with injuries, second-placed Arsenal face a hill to climb, with Liverpool being unbeaten in the league since September.

""If somebody tells you at the start of the season that you play five times with a red card, over half an hour in each of those games, and you have lost this amount of players... you're in the middle of the table at least,"" Arteta said.

""That's not the situation. So that tells you the resilience, resources, the ambition the team has.""

Arteta said that in the 15 matches prior to the loss to West Ham, Arsenal had won the exact same number of points as Liverpool.

""We got that defeat and on top of that, they win... it was a hard one to take,"" the former Arsenal midfielder said.

""The reality is, there's so many games to play. And you have to get back to it. And we have the levels, the consistency and the hunger to go again. And that's what we're going to do on Wednesday.

""At the end you have certain numbers you have to hit to win in this league and we have to hit that number if we're going to have any chance.""

1565372,Indonesia name Cruyff as technical adviser in national team revamp,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia appointed former Barcelona sporting director Jordi Cruyff as the national team's technical adviser, the soccer federation said on Tuesday, in a revamp that has already seen former Netherlands forward Patrick Kluivert named coach.

A passionate soccer country, Indonesian fans are hoping the expanded 48-team World Cup will give them a chance to make the finals for the second time, where they would hope to do better than in 1938 when they travelled to France as the then-Dutch East Indies in the days before group stages, lost 6-0 to Hungary, and went home.

Indonesia are third in their group after six of 10 matches, one point behind Australia in the battle for the second automatic qualification spot. If they finish third or fourth, they could still reach the 2026 finals through further rounds of qualifying and an intercontinental playoff.

Indonesia's soccer federation chief Erick Thohir said Cruyff, who was Barcelona's sporting director from 2021 to 2023, would come in March.

""I'm very excited,"" Cruyff said in a statement on the federation's website. ""I can't wait to share my experience and knowledge to further the level of Indonesian soccer.""

Erick said Cruyff, the 51-year-old son of Barca great Johan Cruyff, embodied Barcelona's philosophy of play.

""What are Jordi's most important tasks? Giving technical input and also developing our soccer philosophy, including by finding us a technical director,"" Erick said, adding Cruyff had signed the agreement with Indonesia earlier on Tuesday.

Cruyff is the latest hire after Kluivert and his assistant coaches, Dutchmen Alex Pastoor and Denny Landzaat.

Kluivert had replaced South Korean coach Shin Tae-yong as Indonesia said it needed stronger leadership.

Shin had benefited from a federation policy of enticing members of the Indonesian diaspora, mostly born in the Netherlands, to play for the national team.

Teams in the 100-ball format can retain 10 players and have been permitted to make one new overseas signing each, before completing their roster by signing players in The Hundred Draft next month and the Wildcard Draft in May.

Smith was set to play for Welsh Fire in the inaugural season of the competition, before it was delayed by a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""I was due to be involved with The Hundred at the beginning of the competition so it's great to finally be able to make it to Wales,"" Smith said.

""I've watched The Hundred from afar and I can't wait to be involved. It looks a lot of fun and obviously the cricket is world class, with talent at every team.""

The Hundred's 2025 season will run from August 5-31.

Afghanistan captain Rashid's acquisition will further strengthen back-to-back title-winning Oval Invincibles, while New Zealand bowler Trent Boult has been drafted in by Birmingham Phoenix.

England's Zak Crawley was not retained by London Spirit, while Ben Stokes will not participate in the competition, with the England men's test captain recovering from a torn left hamstring.

In the women's competition, two-times winners Oval Invincibles have signed Australian captain Meg Lanning, who played for London Spirit in 2024.

Defending women's champions London Spirit did, however, retain Australia's Grace Harris who missed last year through injury.

""The list of players joining the competition looks better than ever, across the men's and the women's competitions,"" said England all-rounder Nat Sciver-Brunt who plays for Trent Rockets in The Hundred.

Briochin have already beaten Ligue 1 sides Nice and Le Havre in the competition, while PSG know the risks after a tough game against fifth-tier Espaly in the round of 32 where they went behind early and needed two late goals to win 4-2.

""If you look at the other teams in Ligue 1, most of them, over half, have been knocked out,"" manager Luis Enrique told reporters ahead of Wednesday's away game.

""If you look at the games against Espaly and Le Mans, we had to dig in, especially against Espaly, so it is impossible to let up.

""Of course, we hope the pitch will allow us to play well. But we also need to dig in tomorrow. We often see how the underdog comes out on top. Sometimes in football a team without attacking could win the match.""

PSG are unbeaten in the league, where they hold a healthy 13-point lead over second placed Olympique de Marseille.

With the home leg of their Champions League last 16 clash with Premier League leaders Liverpool next week and also a league game against Lille before that, the manager believes he has the squad to cope with the busy schedule.

""The most important game is the one tomorrow. And there is also an overall vision with the games coming up in the next month,"" Luis Enrique said.

""Of course the plan can be changed. Because one player could play in this game, one player could play in the one after.

""We have lots of players who can play in different positions. So we can make those changes naturally. To perform at our best against Liverpool, we need to have the right amount of playing time going into it.""

Haaland, who has 27 goals this season in all competitions, suffered a knee injury in City's 4-0 victory over Newcastle on February 15 and was not named for Sunday's 2-0 loss at home to Liverpool, which left City fourth on 44 points.

""Tonight we will know after training,"" Guardiola told reporters on Tuesday of Haaland's prospects of playing against Spurs. ""I hope so, but we don't know yet. He feels better but we will see tomorrow.""

City won the league for the last four seasons but have failed to impress in this one, also crashing out of the Champions League with a humbling 6-3 aggregate defeat to Real Madrid.

They spent over $224 million in the January window to sign Omar Marmoush, Nico Gonzalez, Abdukodir Khusanov, Vitor Reis and Juma Bah, but those players have not yet righted the ship.

Despite their struggles, Guardiola said rebuilding City's squad would not be the biggest challenge of his career, given he had renewed the team several times in the last nine years.

""We have done it two or three times already. It is not the biggest challenge,"" he said. ""The challenge I had is when I was starting my managerial career with my staff. I proved myself and my staff proved we can do it.""

The Spanish manager also praised the performances of academy graduate Rico Lewis, who has frequently started at right back for the club since the departure of Kyle Walker to AC Milan.

""Since he arrived in the first team he has been really good. He is not a good defender but he is an exceptional defender. He is so smart and intelligent,"" Guardiola said.

""His physicality is not like a typical defender in this country but he is really good, especially with the ball.""

“The majority of tenants fall under the fashion and accessories category, accounting for 42%, followed by salons as well as handphone and gadget stores, each at 12%.

“The mall management is focusing on expanding its food-and-beverage section, which currently makes up 7% of total tenancy.

“Plans are afoot to attract more event organisers to host local food fairs, to increase foot traffic and enhance the shopping experience at the mall,” said Chan during a Chinese New Year dinner for the mall’s retail lot owners at a restaurant in George Town.

Chan (fifth from left) and Azmin (on his right) with guests tossing ‘yee sang’ at the start of the Chinese New Year dinner.

He said in an effort to remain competitive, KBJ had organised a series of events and campaigns throughout last year, such as its annual Ramadan bazaar, bubur lambuk distribution for the poor as well as Penang Hijab Fashion and Culture Week.

“We have also joined the ‘green revolution’ by installing a new electric vehicle (EV) charging station, which can be accessed through the Power Bee app.

“We have solar panels too on our rooftop, installed at a cost of RM1.6mil, and this is saving us RM12,000 a month in electricity,” said Chan.

He said the mall had undergone infrastructure upgrades, including a new roof.

Starting next year, he said KBJ would transition to e-invitations, eliminating physical cards, as part of its efforts to reduce operational costs and embrace technology.

Chan urged tenants and partners to update their contact details and stay informed through the mall’s official WhatsApp chat group.

“E-invoicing will also be implemented from July, in compliance with the directive by Inland Revenue Board,” he said.

On Monday, United announced they would cut 150-200 jobs as part of an overhaul to return to profitability after five years of losses, in addition to 250 jobs removed last year.

The club has been restructuring and cutting costs since British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe took a 25% stake last year.

""We have to address all the problems in the club but one important piece is how we got into this situation. It has to do a lot with the lack of success of the football team,"" Amorim told reporters ahead of Wednesday's Premier League match at home against Ipswich Town.

""We are the engine of the club. I want to help the team with my job which is to help the team, help the players and the success.

""It's always hard for everybody. They see their friends and teammates losing their jobs but again, I have to focus on what I can do to help the club in this moment and we as a club have to understand what we did wrong to get in this situation.""

United have endured a torrid season and a three-match winless run in the Premier League has left them 15th in the standings.

Asked if the negativity surrounding the club would make it harder for players to perform, Amorim said: ""It's hard enough to win football matches.

""This year has been really hard for everybody because as a club we have had a lot of changes. If you have a football club that is playing well and winning games, it is easier for the fans and everybody to feel the changes.

""In this moment, we are in a difficult period inside the club and on the pitch. We have to do our job and try our best to help the team to perform better.""

“Of this number, more than half − 7,602 − were calls for humanitarian services, while 32.9% or 4,509 involved fire.

“Other calls included those related to rescue operations (1,298) and special tasks (293), while the remaining 15 were fake calls,” she said during the department’s monthly assembly at its headquarters.

She noted a downward trend in the number of calls the department received last year compared to 2023, when it handled 14,452 calls.

Siti Rohani said the department had also conducted 1,819 fire investigations, an increase from the 1,412 cases attended to in 2023.

U.S. media has reported that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the world's largest contract chipmaker and a major supplier to companies including Apple and Nvidia, has been in talks to potentially take a stake in Intel.

Neither TSMC nor Intel has confirmed the reports.

Any large overseas investment by a Taiwanese company needs government approval, specifically from the economy ministry's investment review commission.

Speaking to reporters in Taipei, Economy Minister Kuo Jyh-huei said he could not comment on market rumours, and the ministry would only have ""certain discussions"" if it received an official ""report"" from TSMC.

""Because it involves foreign investment it would go through our investment commission. So far we have not received any information, so I have no way to comment on this issue,"" Kuo said.

U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticised Taiwan, saying it has taken away American semiconductor business and that he wants manufacturing to return to the United States.

Trump has threatened to put tariffs both on semiconductor imports and countries with which the United States has a large trade imbalance.

Taiwan runs a large trade surplus with the United States.

Earlier this month, one of the economy ministry's deputy ministers, Cynthia Kiang, visited the United States for talks.

Kuo said that trip was to ""collect information"" and talk with current and former U.S. officials.

Veeam's software is designed to help customers quickly recover their data after cybersecurity incidents, ransomware attacks or accidental data loss.

Its core product supports immutable backups to prevent ransomware from modifying or deleting data, ensuring that clean copies remain available for recovery even if hackers encrypt files.

Microsoft had invested in cybersecurity firm Rubrik in 2021, which also offers data backup and recovery solutions.

Veeam said it would focus on research and development investments and design collaboration, among others, with the support of Microsoft. It will also integrate Microsoft's AI services into its products.

U.S. private equity firm Insight Partners, which is the largest shareholder in Veeam, sold a $2 billion stake in the company in a secondary sale valuing the firm at $15 billion, it said in December last year.

Veeam was acquired by Insight Partners for about $5 billion in 2020.

Founded in 2006, Veeam has more than 550,000 customers globally including corporations such as Deloitte and Canon, according to its website.

First released in 1990, Adobe's digital image software is enough of a household name to have become a verb for touching up photos. But it has always cost money, and the lowest-cost version previously was a $9.99 per month subscription for Apple's iPad.

Adobe has now released a free version for Apple's iPhone, with an Android app coming soon, Adobe executives told Reuters. Adobe will offer a premium version for $7.99 a month that includes more features as well as access to more cloud storage and the web-based version of Photoshop for editing on larger screens.

The move comes as mobile operating systems from Apple and Alphabet's Google have replicated, for free, many longtime Photoshop features such as adjusting a photo's colors or removing some distracting objects.

Adobe's software for creative professionals still makes up more than half of its sales at a time when the company in December gave a 2025 revenue forecast that missed Wall Street expectations.

Deepa Subramaniam, Adobe's vice president of product marketing for creative professional apps, said the company is focused on courting younger users whose phones are their primary camera and editing device when they need more tools than a phone's operating system offers.

Even the free version of the Photoshop app will have features such as splitting a photo into separate layers, masking off parts of it and adding text - all of which can be used to create cover shots for podcasts, streaming music playlists or YouTube videos.

""We spent a lot of time and energy testing directly with our target user base, which is the next-generation creator who does a lot on their phone. It is the way that they express personal creativity, and the application is really built for them,"" Subramaniam told Reuters.

Alibaba's announcement follows similar action from startup DeepSeek whose ostensibly low-cost open-source models earlier this year generated excitement among technology investors and surprise in the capital-intensive sector with performance akin to those of more established rivals such as OpenAI.

Alibaba said it has released four variants of Wan 2.1 - T2V-1.3B, T2V-14B, I2V-14B-720P and I2V-14B-480P - which generate images and videos from text and image input. The ""14B"" indicates the variant accepts 14 billion parameters, meaning it can process far more input to yield more accurate results.

The models are available globally on Alibaba Cloud's ModelScope and HuggingFace platforms for academic, research and commercial.

Alibaba introduced the latest version of its video- and image-generating AI model in January - later shortening its name to Wan from Wanx - touting its ability to generate highly realistic visuals.

The firm has since highlighted its top ranking on VBench, a leaderboard for video generative models, where it leads in functionality such as multi-object interaction.

On Tuesday, Alibaba released a preview of reasoning model QwQ-Max which it plans to make open source upon full release.

It also announced plans this week to invest at least 380 billion yuan ($52 billion) over the next three years to bolster cloud computing and AI infrastructure.

Abd Hamid said Bandar Sentosa, which is sandwiched between Jalan Sungai Jati and Jalan Kebun Nenas and bordered by Lorong Dato Dagang 52/KS7 and Jalan Raja Nong, had a Sentosa Township Action Plan to serve a 890ha area with a population of about 93,000.

“Bandar Sentosa has gone through piecemeal development, and public facilities were not provided in a comprehensive manner.

“This action plan has taken into account the current needs of Bandar Sentosa,” he added.

Abd Hamid said based on MBDK’s Local Plan 2035 (Amendment 1), the largest land use in Bandar Sentosa is residential, followed by industrial and commercial zones.

“Bandar Sentosa is well connected with good transportation networks via Jalan Kebun, Jalan Sungai Jati, Jalan Raja Nong, Jalan Kebun Nenas and Persiaran Puteri as well as Shah Alam Expressway (Kesas) and West Coast Expressway,” he said.

1564102,"Australia fines Telegram over response to terror, abuse content","SYDNEY: Australia's online watchdog said on Feb 24 it has fined Telegram more than US$600,000 (RM2.65mil) for missing a deadline to reveal how it tackles ""terrorist"" and child sexual abuse content.

The encrypted messaging firm replied more than five months after the May 6, 2024 limit for disclosing its online safety compliance, eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said.

In March last year, the watchdog asked Telegram and other platforms what they were doing to detect ""terrorist"", violent extremist, and child sexual exploitation content, she said in a statement.

Telegram did not reply until October 13, obstructing the commission's work for almost half a year, she said.

""Surfacing how and where some of these platforms might be failing – and also succeeding – in tackling this content is vital to protect the community and raise safety standards across the industry, especially where this most abhorrent of content is concerned.""

Telegram, which was fined Aus$958,000 (RM2.69mil or US$613,000), has 28 days to pay the penalty, seek more time to pay, or try to get it withdrawn.

If it decides not to pay, the commission can seek a penalty in the federal court.

Telegram's Russian-born founder and chief executive Pavel Durov was arrested in August last year at a Paris airport and later charged with several counts of failing to curb extremist and terrorist content on the app.

French prosecutors also claimed the Dubai-based platform had failed to take action against child sexual abuse imagery.

Durov, who was released on a €5mil (RM23.13mil) bail, later announced a crackdown on illegal content. – AFP",Tech,2025-02-24,260
1564080,Fahmi: Govt in talks with TikTok to reinstate 18 media accounts banned by AI,"KUALA LUMPUR: Communications Minister Fahmi Fadzil said the recent banning of 18 TikTok accounts belonging to media outlets was the result of artificial intelligence (AI) moderation.

Among those affected was Bernama, the national news agency. Fahmi said preliminary reports suggest the bans were related to the outlets' coverage of the alleged child molestation case in Batang Kali.

""AI can miss the mark from time to time, it does not understand that reports made by media outlets are different from the content produced by ordinary people.

""I have asked for a discussion in the near future to give some leeway or establish a different status to TikTok accounts belonging to the media companies so that such incidents will not happen again in the future,"" he said.

He said the government has requested TikTok to restore the accounts and provide an explanation to both the government and the media.

TikTok’s community guidelines state that Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) is not permitted, including any screenshots or clips from the original material, even if they do not depict nudity or sexual activity.

TikTok had previously informed the government that it would be increasing the use of AI moderation, according to Fahmi.

LifestyleTech has reached out to TikTok and the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) but has not received a response as of publication time.

Fahmi made these comments after his opening address at the launch of the ""AI in the Newsroom"" programme, organised by Bernama with support from Huawei and Redtone.

The two-day course, offering 40 slots for news editors and reporters from various publications, aims to encourage media practitioners to adopt AI technology.

1564294,"MyStep officers to support secondary schools, Parliament told","KUALA LUMPUR: A total of 548 MyStep officers will be introduced as teaching assistants at 274 secondary schools nationwide, the Dewan Rakyat was told.

Education Minister Fadhlina Sidek said the officers would be placed at schools with more than 1,500 students starting this year.

Seven special education schools have also been identified to participate in this initiative.

""Each school will receive two MyStep personnel as teacher assistants,"" she said during her winding-up speech in Parliament on Monday (Feb 24).

Fadhlina added that the ministry is focused on ensuring teachers can concentrate on meaningful learning and teaching activities.

Separately, she said teachers have the option to choose their preferred subject to teach, as per a ministry circular in 2022.

""This process aims to recognise teachers' professional fields based on their years of experience, allowing better education delivery,"" she said.

As a long-term strategy, Fadhlina said the ministry has five-year outlooks to ensure the need for teachers, according to options, is always met.

""This allows us to plan new teacher intakes for vacancies in government schools,"" she said.

She explained that this is also a yearly process, enabling the Education Services Commission to carry out their work.

""The Ministry will measure needs annually and consider any changes due to policy or education,"" she added.

On February 18, The Star reported that education groups warned of a growing teacher shortage, with nearly 12,000 teachers taking early retirement between 2022 and 2023.

In 2023, 6,394 teachers took early retirement, an increase from the previous year when 5,306 left the profession, Deputy Education Minister Wong Kah Woh told the Dewan Rakyat last year.

According to the Education Ministry in a parliamentary written reply on June 26 last year, most teachers left early because they were uninterested in their roles. Other factors included family, health, job duties, and personal reasons.",Others,2025-02-24,304
1562483,Why women feel the cold more,"What for some of us is a comfortable temperature, is for others too chilly.

People’s heat perception varies and their sex plays a role.

Women feel cold quicker than men do, as the many thermostat battles in homes and offices can attest.

“They typically have less muscle mass, and therefore, a lower metabolic rate, and generate less heat,” says German Physiological Society (DPG) board member and Goethe University of Frankfurt professor of physiology Dr Ralf Brandes.

More muscle mass increases your rate of metabolism, even at rest, meaning you burn food to fuel your body faster – a process that heats your body up.

And contractions of skeletal muscles, whether voluntarily or involuntarily through shivering, are a primary source of heat production.

The reason men typically have more muscle mass likely lies in evolutionary history.

While prehistoric men hunted – moving around and generating heat – women and children often stayed behind in their dwellings, says Oscar Langendorff Institute for Physiology director Dr Rudiger Kohling at the Rostock University Medical Centre in Germany.

However, “women are better at centralising heat”, he adds, namely by directing more blood carrying heat to their body’s core in response to cold.

“Meanwhile, blood circulation to the extremities – such as hands, feet, nose and lips – is restricted,” explains Prof Brandes.

This prioritises women’s vital organs, including reproductive organs.

“But it also means that women’s skin cools more quickly,” Dr Kohling notes, which can be seen in blue lips and pale, white hands, for instance.

Older people are said to feel chilly quickly too, even though studies suggest that their juniors have a greater sensation of cold since the nerve cells in their skin function better, Prof Brandes says.

Seniors tend to get less exercise though, as well as lose muscle mass and have a lower metabolic rate.

So their bodies generate less heat and they feel chilly more quickly than they did when they were younger.

Alas, “a declining metabolic rate is a part of growing older”, Prof Brandes says.

The recourse?

""As I have said before, the collection of PTPTN loan repayments needs to continue,"" he told the media after delivering the keynote address at the ASEAN Universities Exhibition and Forum 2025 on Monday (Feb 24).

1564098,Early literacy efforts reduce number of Year One students lacking 3M skills,"KUALA LUMPUR: Early literacy detection and intervention efforts have reduced the number of Year One students lacking 3M skills—reading, writing, and counting—in 2025, says Deputy Education Minister Wong Kah Woh

He said the number of Year One students who have not mastered 3M skills dropped to 49,677 in 2025 from 73,736 in 2024 and 76,262 in 2023.

In 2024, the ministry's early assessment found that 122,062 students (27.4%) needed intervention to learn 3M skills.

These students received extra help in phases from July to September and October to December last year.

""Overall, 59.3% or 72,385 Year One students identified in the early literacy and numeracy detection have successfully mastered the 3Rs in 2024,"" he said.

""For the remaining 49,677 students who have not yet mastered these skills, they will undergo a special remedial programme in Year Two.""

Ahmad Saad @ Yahaya (PN-Pokok Sena) asked about special remedial intervention programmes for low literacy levels in Year One.

Wong said the initial intervention phase from July to September 2024 helped 39.58% or 48,308 students master the 3Ms.

The second phase, from October to December 2024, helped an additional 32.65% or 24,077 students from the remaining group master the 3Ms.

He said challenges in ensuring Year One students master the 3Ms are not limited to pedagogical aspects but are also influenced by socioeconomic factors, student readiness, and the home environment.

For students from B40 families and rural areas, the National Education Foundation (Yayasan Didik Negara) was established to mobilise community donations for students and educational institutions.

""We have provided early schooling assistance this year with an allocation of RM791mil, and the school meals and materials programme has continued with an allocation of RM869mil,"" he said.

The ministry has developed a preschool curriculum for 2024, focusing on enhancing students' readiness before entering formal schooling.

Wong said the ministry would expand the number of preschool classes, with 130 classes opened as of Feb 16, and more to come.

""Additionally, initiatives are taken to expand the establishment of ministry preschools not only in primary schools but also in teacher training institutes, secondary schools, vocational colleges, and other institutions under the ministry,"" he added.",Others,2025-02-24,357

In a recent YouTube video, Liu, 67, shared that his symptoms first appeared in late November 2024, when he experienced stiffness and numbness on the left side of his jaw.

Although he took some medication that provided slight relief then, the discomfort returned days later.

One day, while having a meal, Liu, best known for his performance in the 1979 drama The Good, The Bad And The Ugly, suddenly felt unwell.

The former TVB star, who now specialises in organic farm products, recalled experiencing extreme fatigue at that moment and took a nap in his car after driving home.

“Halfway through my sleep, I suddenly felt the urge to use the toilet. There was discomfort on the top of my head, and when I touched it, I felt a strange lump!

“The inside of my lips also felt swollen,” he shared, adding that the swelling only subsided after he used the toilet.

Then, in December, Liu suddenly felt weakness in his left leg.

“I had no sensation at all. This is bad – it’s a stroke!” he lamented.

Although a friend offered to take him to the hospital, Liu refused, choosing to rely on his own medication instead.

Liu has explored multiple treatment options to support his recovery. Photo: Liu Wai Hung/YouTube“My circulation improved after I took my medicine, and I regained mobility,” he said.

The same episode occurred two days later, and Liu turned to his own remedies once again. But over time, he noticed that the muscles in his left leg had visibly shrunk.

Liu, who shares a son with a Malaysian-born woman, also revealed that he has gout in his right leg.

The former actor has since sought various treatments, including acupuncture, which he found to be very helpful.

“I’m about 60% recovered now,” he shared, adding that this whole ordeal has been eye-opening.

Petaling Jaya mayor Mohamad Zahri Samingon said with the upgrade, the operations of the crematorium will be privatised.

As the crematorium is on state land, he said MBPJ was in the process of resolving land-related matters with the Selangor government before transferring the operations to the private company.

“The refurbishment will involve the enhancement of the crematorium, as well as a new columbarium, casket showroom, mortuary preparation room and management office,” he said.

Mohamad Zahri added that the columbarium would have a capacity to hold 10,000 urns.

“The project is expected to cost between RM8mil and RM12mil.

“The concession period will be set at 21 years, subject to state’s approval,” he said at the city council’s full board meeting.

Although the private company would manage the crematorium’s operations, MBPJ would continue to oversee the management of the facilities to ensure high-quality service, Mohamad Zahri said.

“Service charges will also be regulated to ensure they remain reasonable.

“The improvements to this crematorium will benefit local residents and provide better organised, comfortable and modern funeral services.

“This will also help ensure each funeral service is carried out smoothly and safely to meet the needs of the community.”

Separately, in conjunction with Ramadan, MBPJ has designated 18 locations for bazaar operations offering 1,260 trading lots.

Mohamad Zahri said MBPJ would implement separated trading lots and promote cashless transactions to ensure better convenience, reduce waste and encourage recycling.

“This year, MBPJ is collaborating with hotels and companies to distribute leftover food from the bazaars to those in need through the Bakul Bahagia Ramadan @PJ initiative.

Additionally, MBPJ was giving out RM30,000 in digital coupons, each worth RM15, to visitors who brought reusable bags at 12 bazaar locations, Mohamad Zahri said, adding that about 100 MBPJ staff would be assigned bazaar duty to monitor cleanliness, safety and compliance.

After weeks of training, Herry sees strong potential in the pair and has set a semi-final target for them.

“Besides Arif-Roy King, there is also Aaron Tai-Khang Khai Xing in the German meet, but I’m really hoping for Arif-Roy King to reach the semi-finals at least,” said Herry.

“They’ve been performing well in training. I believe Arif-Roy King have a good chance, but we will see how things unfold once the tournament begins.

“As for Aaron-Khai Xing, they are still young and new to Super 300 level tournaments, so they may find it tough against higher-ranked opponents.

Arif-Roy King will kick off their campaign when they face Denmark’s William Kryger Boe-Christian Faust Kjaer for the first time in the first round.

However, their biggest test is expected in the quarter-finals, where they are likely to face South Korea’s Seo Seung-jae-Kim Won-ho, the seventh seeds.

“Our dog shelter at Bandar Sultan Suleiman in Port Klang is a safe haven for lost dogs,” he added.

If owners of the dogs brought to the shelter do not claim them in seven days, the animals will be put up for adoption.

While focussing on the singles, he had continued playing in the doubles with Lok Hong Quan, a partnership that started in 2019.

Faiq said the decision was made last month, just days before the Under-21 National Championships in Kuantan, Pahang.

Despite entering the tournament at the last minute, he and Hong Quan went on to clinch the title after defeating Loh Zi Heng and Tan Zhi Yang in the final.

Now, they are set for their first international tournament of the year at the Sri Lanka International Challenge, which begins tomorrow.

Faiq-Hong Quan will face Indonesia’s Muh Putra Erwiansyah and Daniel Edgar Marvinho.

He said he felt more comfortable in doubles with Hong Quan.

“I feel even more motivated now that my request has been granted, but I also know I need to stay focused since I am now concentrating on just one event,” he said.

During his junior years, the Selangor-born player competed in both singles and doubles, including at last year’s World Junior Championships in Nanchang, China. He reached the quarter-finals in the singles but lost in the last 16 in the doubles.

Now that he has been allowed to rejoin the men’s doubles squad under Herry, he is determined to make the most of this opportunity.

“Before this decision was made, we had a discussion, especially with coach (Kenneth) Jonassen, who held one-on-one sessions with all the players. I spoke with him during that time.

“Later, he told me he needed to bring the matter to Rexy, and not long after, I was informed that I could focus on men’s doubles,” said Faiq.",Sport,2025-02-24,318

1563322,UM country’s top in global subject rankings,"UNIVERSITI Malaya (UM) claimed the top position in seven out of 11 subject categories in Malaysia, according to The Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings by Subject 2025.

The rankings, released on Jan 22, also placed UM among the top three in every discipline evaluated, including Business and Economics, Medicine and Health, Education, Engineering, Life Sciences, Psychology, Social Sciences and Computer Science.

For Computer Science, the varsity, together with Universiti Teknologi Petronas and Universiti Sains Malaysia in the 201-250 global band, were jointly ranked number one in the country.

This year also marked UM’s entry into the Law subject rankings for the first time. The varsity, ranked in the 151-175 band, was in second place with Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, in the 101-125 global band, claiming top spot. In the 176-200 global band, Universiti Utara Malaysia (UUM) is the country’s third highest ranked Law institution.

In addition to excelling in these subjects, UM also improved its global rankings in five subject areas.

UM vice-chancellor Prof Datuk Seri Dr Noor Azuan Abu Osman expressed pride in the varsity’s achievements, particularly in Law, emphasising its commitment to world-class quality and academic standards.

“This is in line with our ultimate aspiration to create breakthroughs for the world, and to contribute to civilisational progress. The success in these rankings is a testament to the dedication and hard work of the entire campus community, especially our academic and research talent, as well as our non-academic workforce who have worked tirelessly and with great tenacity to meet our internal Key Performance Indicators,” he said in a statement.

In a separate statement, UUM vice-chancellor Prof Datuk Dr Mohd Foad Sakdan said that the achievement is a major step forward in UUM’s continuous efforts to establish itself as a top institution for higher education globally, especially in the legal field.

“The UUM Law School has shown a notable increase in high-impact research, while successfully forging a network of strategic collaborations with international institutions and professional bodies,” he said.

1561755,No more green speech bubbles: Customised chats arrive on Whatsapp,"BERLIN: After years of forcing all users to message in the same old green speech bubbles, WhatsApp is now opening up its interface to new chat themes that can be customised.

WhatsApp already allowed users to set an individual background photo for chats, but only now can you also set the colour of speech bubbles that display the chat messages.

You can either choose from new chat themes that are already fully configured with their own matching background or you can determine the colours for the speech bubbles and the backgrounds yourself.

One benefit to choosing individual colours and backgrounds for certain chats is that it makes you less likely to accidentally send a message to the wrong contact or group chat. If you associate, say, green with family, then you're less likely to post a private message in a group work chat that has a purple theme.

A total of 30 new stock background options are available, but you can also use your own photos.

You can also set one bespoke design globally for all chats. If preferred, you can also design each individual chat or group chat differently.

In any case, the design changes are only visible to you, and not to other contacts.

Here's how to change your chat theme:

Global: To set up a design for all chats and channels, navigate to Settings/Chats/Default chat theme.

Specific: To customise a chat individually, tap the name of the respective chat at the top on iOS. On Android, tap the three-dot menu and select ""Chat theme"".

Please note: According to Meta, the new features will only be introduced gradually. It may take a few weeks before they are available to all users and on all devices. – dpa",Tech,2025-02-23,289
1561729,RIP photography: AI-made images now more popular than real ones,"SAN JOSE: In news no snapper or shutterbug wants to hear, Google and Scandinavian publisher Bonnier News have published research showing that artificial intelligence-generated images are proving more popular than real photographs.

After teaming up to develop a product called BonsAI, Bonnier and the Google News Initiative found in tests that the imagery it churns out usually gets higher click-through rates (CTR) than photos.

""Early results show BonsAI-generated images significantly outperform stock images in ads,"" Bonnier and Google said in a joint statement, adding that ""in several cases, the AI images delivered an astounding 100% improvement in CTR over the original images.""

While they do not advocate for the use of AI-conjured images with news articles, the Google-Bonnier tie-up follows the rapid uptake of AI by some news organisations.

By mid-2023, around half of newsrooms were using chatbots, according to a World Association of Publishers (WAN-IFRA) survey.

If publishers are tempted to use AI fakes ahead of photos, it could put an end to many photographers' hopes of making ends meet.

Getty Images, which provides news photos and stock through its iStock offering, recently agreed a US$3.7bil (RM16.3bil) merger with Shutterstock.

The announcement was greeted with criticism in some quarters, with commentators on social media nicknaming the new entity as ""Gutterstock.""

In a joint statement, the two companies said the tie-up is aimed at meeting ""evolving needs of creative, media and advertising industries through combined investment in content creation, event coverage and product and technology innovation.""

Another aim, they said, is to generate ""annual cost synergies between US$150mil (RM664mil) and US$200mil (RM885mil) by year three."" As it stands, photographers who upload to either platform can end up getting as little as US$0.10 (RM0.44) per image sale, depending on the terms and exclusivity rights. – dpa",Tech,2025-02-23,295

Niantic is in negotiations over the sale of its gaming business for around US$3.5bil (RM15.5bil), financial news wire Bloomberg reported on Wednesday, citing sources close to the negotiations.

The prospective buyer is said to be Scopely, a mobile games production company backed by the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund and behind titles like Star Trek Fleet Command, Scrabble Go and The Walking Dead: Road to Survival.

Pokémon Go became an instant worldwide hit when it was launched in the summer of 2016, and while the hype subsided somewhat in the years that followed, the game remained popular among a loyal fanbase.

The game was of the first major apps to make use of what is called Augmented Reality, whereby the user sees digital content mapped on top of a live feed of the real world seen through their smartphone's camera lens.

The game allows you to catch characters from the Pokémon games on your smartphone screen in real-life surroundings. Niantic has since struggled to repeat the success of the original Pokémon Go game with other titles.

Niantic also develops technology for displaying three-dimensional environments, technology that could come into play for future Scopely games.

Bloomberg reported that a deal to sell the gaming business could be announced in the coming weeks. Niantic did not respond for comment on the report. – dpa",Tech,2025-02-23,253
1563225,UMS student leader to be charged over protest rally,"KOTA KINABALU: A student leader from Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS) is set to face two charges under the Peaceful Assembly Act.

Suara Mahasiswa UMS president Muhamad Fadhil Muhamad Kasim, 25, will be charged under Section 509 of the Penal Code, which pertains to using words, gestures, or acts intended to insult a person's modesty, and Section 9(5) of the Peaceful Assembly Act, which requires organisers to notify the relevant police district at least five days before an assembly.

His court dates are fixed for April 21 and 22.

Suara Mahasiswa UMS had held an anti-corruption gathering outside Menara Kinabalu on Dec 31, 2024, calling for greater transparency and integrity.

According to the movement's deputy president Qistina Qaisara Syahril Akmar, Fadhil was summoned to the Kota Kinabalu district police headquarters on Feb 21.

She questioned why the investigation was taking place, saying that the government had recently called for amendments to the Peaceful Assembly Act and ceasing investigations into students involved in anti-corruption demonstrations.

""This action does not reflect the Prime Minister's guarantee and the government's commitment that no action would be taken against protestors,"" she said in a statement on Saturday (Feb 22).

On Feb 13, Anwar said in Parliament that a moratorium had been imposed to halt all ongoing investigations under Section 11 of the Peaceful Assembly Act 2012 as there were plans to amend it. The section requires rally organisers to obtain permission from venue owners.

The Prime Minister said that these amendments are scheduled to be tabled in the next parliamentary session.

1562361,"Car safety tech has ‘blind spot’ for high-vis jackets, study suggests","LONDON: High-visibility clothing and reflective strips may make pedestrians and cyclists invisible to modern car technology, a study suggests.

Automatic emergency braking (AEB) systems, which are fitted to all new cars, automatically apply the brakes if the potential for a collision is detected and the driver fails to respond quickly enough.

A study by the US-based Insurance Institute for Highway Safety indicated the systems may have a “blind spot” for reflective items.

Researchers conducted trials involving a crash test dummy and three cars travelling at 25 mph (40 km/h): a Honda CR-V, Mazda CX-5 and Subaru Forester.

In the tests, the Honda and Mazda hit the dummy when it was wearing reflective strips, while the Honda also failed to slow down when a high-visibility jacket was put on the mannequin.

The Subaru slowed down in all tests except when the dummy was wearing reflective strips in very low light.

IIHS president David Harkey said: “These results suggest that some automakers need to tweak their pedestrian automatic emergency braking systems.

“It’s untenable that the clothes that pedestrians, cyclists and roadway workers wear to be safe may make them harder for crash avoidance technology to recognise.”

He added: “This is a worrisome blind spot.”

Study author David Kidd said: “The placement and motion of reflective strips on the joints and limbs of (trousers) and jackets allows drivers to quickly recognise the pattern of movement as a person.

“Unfortunately, the moving strips didn’t have the same effect for the pedestrian AEB systems we tested and probably confounded their sensors.”

Mazda said in a statement: “Road safety for everyone, including those in and around our vehicles, is a top priority for Mazda.

“Our engineers are continuously working to improve Mazda’s crash avoidance systems and are already using these latest IIHS results to further assist us in this work, with special consideration for nighttime pedestrian scenarios.”

1562357,Google adds school mode and other parenting features to Family Link,"BERLIN: Google has updated its parenting app Family Link with a new option to set a certain time of the day as ""school time"" to block any distractions a child might get from their phone.

The school time feature, previously only available for certain Fitbit and Samsung smartwatches, is now rolling out for all Android devices, including smartphones and tablets.

Google is also letting parents manage their children's contacts using the Family Link app. A parent can then approve, restrict or pause notifications in phone or messaging apps for certain time frames.

In the coming months, Google plans to add an option whereby parents can authorise certain contacts on smartphones and tablets (from Android 14 up). The child can then contact only these people using Google Messages or with the phone app.

The app will also let parents restrict contact options for existing contacts. Children will be able to request that their parents add new contacts. Currently, contact management only works on Samsung's Galaxy Watch Kids.

However this feature works best for Google Messages users, and your child will essentially still be able to contact whomever they want on third-party apps like WhatsApp or Signal. The emergency call will always be accessible regardless of the settings.

The revised Family Link user interface comes with a new screen time tab that, in addition to an app- and device-specific usage overview and time limits, also allows you to set the quiet time and school mode features.

And the settings tab should now make it easier to manage the children's account, privacy settings and download rules, as well as the content filter.

If you manage multiple children's accounts and devices, you can now simply swipe back and forth between the different profiles to switch in the Family Link app. – dpa/Tribune News Service",Tech,2025-02-22,300

PUTRAJAYA: Putting an end to bullying and sexual harassment in schools will be the focus of the Education Ministry this year, says director-general Azman Adnan (pic).

It is part of efforts to ensure the well-being of school leaders, teachers and students, he added.

“Issues such as bullying, work stress and sexual harassment will be dealt with firmly at all levels.

“This is in line with the wishes of Education Minister Fadhlina Sidek who often reminds the leadership in all educational institutions under the ministry not to compromise when it comes to bullying and sexual harassment,” he said here yesterday in his address to the ministry for the start of the 2025/26 school year.

Azman also said such issues need to be dealt with efficiently and according to the guidelines that have been prepared and distribu­ted.

In addition to the guidelines, which are “complete to help schools handle the issues”, he said the ministry also collaborates with other parties such as the police, local authorities and the Health Ministry to raise awareness among the public.

“While these efforts have been around for a while, we will be more aggressive this year with our collaboration,” he added.

This would be covered when the Education Bill 2025 (Amendment): Continuation of Com­pulsory Education from Primary Education is tabled in parliament, he added.

Azman said reforming schools is also on the agenda to improve the quality of education through establishing an efficient administration, ­teachers’ work culture and student competencies.

Other priority areas are education leadership, improving teacher professionalism, improving students’ literacy and numeracy, more participation in international student assessments, and forming a Madani generation.

He called on the ministry’s staff to work together to achieve its aspirations through strategic actions and comprehensive implementation.

On Feb 9, Jonathan Challinger posted on social media site X that his Tesla Cybertruck operating on self-driving technology failed to merge out of an ending lane before driving straight over a curb and into a lamppost.

The car ""made no attempt to slow down or turn until it had already hit the curb,"" Challinger said in a the post, which received nearly two million views and was later deleted. He attached a photo of the crash site, which shows the front of the Cybertruck bisected by the lamppost; debris litters the street.

""Thank you @Tesla for engineering the best passive safety in the world, he wrote. ""I walked away without a scratch.""

The crash report comes after Musk promised in January that Tesla will roll out fully autonomous robotaxis this summer in Austin. The tech mogul said ""unsupervised Full Self-Driving"" will expand to California and other regions of the US by the end of the 2025.

Tesla's self-driving feature can navigate curves, intersections, left and right turns, roundabouts, and highways, according to the Cybertruck owner's manual.

However, Tesla manuals are clear that drivers must still be ""fully attentive"" while its autonomous driving technology is enabled. The feature itself is referred to as Full Self-Driving (Supervised) and the Cybertruck manual says drivers must keep their hands on the steering wheel.

""Driver intervention may be required in certain situations, such as on narrow roads with oncoming cars, in construction zones, or while going through complex intersections,"" the Cybertruck manual says, accompanied by a red warning symbol.

In his viral social media post, Challinger blamed himself for the crash and offered to send dashboard camera footage and data to Tesla to prevent future accidents.

Manchester City face the prospect of a second hiding this week, following their exit from the Champions League, orchestrated by Real Madrid.

Guardiola has conceded more than once in recent weeks that they are in a dark place and are finding it difficult to emerge from.

This is in stark contrast to the club’s fortunes that saw them bask in glory as they won four league titles in a row last season, and dominated the English game for the best part of a decade and a half.

The 3-1 beating at the hands of Real in Madrid, which ensured a 6-3 aggregate win for the defending champions, will be fresh in the memory when Liverpool visit, hoping to maintain their lead at the top of the Premiership.

Presently, the Reds are eight points ahead of Arsenal, who play today and could reduce that cushion somewhat.

But if City are to thwart Liverpool’s advances and consolidate their top four standing, they will need to exercise more caution in defence and hope that Norwegian Erling Haaland plays and gets among the goals.

The striker is a carrying a knee injury he picked up in the Newcastle game.

“It’s relatively easy for me to mourn someone, but commenting too much would be too painful,” the 43-year-old said.

Chou, who was part of the boy band F4, also emphasised that the feelings of Hsu’s family should take precedence, adding: “People like me on the sidelines aren’t a priority.”

Hsu and Chou first met on the set of the 2001 series Meteor Garden and later reunited for the 2004 drama Mars.

Their romance became public when Hsu was spotted rushing to visit Chou after he was involved in a car accident. They split in 2008 after two years of dating.

When asked if he had extended his condolences to Hsu’s family, Chou admitted they had not been in contact for a long time.

“I rarely appear on variety shows too, so we hardly ever meet,” he added.

It’s worth noting that a fan had previously created a social media account under Chou’s name, sharing multiple tributes to mourn Hsu. The account was later confirmed to be fake after being reported.

In the recent interview, Chou said this was his first time learning about the matter.

The actor stated that he would’ve taken action if someone had hacked into his account. However, if it was a case of someone using a fake account to post under his name, he considered it a common occurrence online.

“Unless the posts contain extreme sentiments, I won’t pay much attention to them.

“I’ve been absent from the Internet for over 15 years, so those who know me wouldn’t believe it’s me,” he said.

Hsu, who was 48, died in Japan on Feb 2 due to complications from influenza. Her remains were transported back to Taiwan on Feb 5.",Lifestyle,2025-02-21,332

The German sandal maker had sought a ruling that its footwear, known for its cork and latex soles, could be classified as art and thus afforded strong copyright protections.

The company, whose sandals have over the years transformed from unglamorous footwear to coveted fashion items, wanted to stop three of its competitors from selling similar products.

It had wanted the products of the trio – German retailers Tchibo and shoe.com, as well as the Danish retailer Bestseller – to be pulled from the shelves and destroyed.

But the Federal Court of Justice in Karlsruhe sided with the judgement of a lower court, ruling that Birkenstock's sandals could not be considered ""copyrighted works of applied art"".

""For copyright protection to apply, there must be such a degree of design that the product displays some individuality,"" the court said.

""Pure craftsmanship using formal design elements"" was not enough, said the court, bringing a close to a legal saga that began in May 2023.

Despite the ruling, Birkenstock defended bringing the case.

""We want to ensure that copycats can no longer make money at the expense of our brand,"" said company spokesman Jochen Gutzy.

Founded in 1774 in a small community in southwest Germany as a firm focused on making orthopaedic footwear, Birkenstock has grown into a global footwear titan.

Herry said he is putting the Paris 2024 Olympic bronze medallists through a new training regime to ensure they are fully prepared for the world’s oldest badminton tournament.

""They have a good chance, but I feel their preparations have not yet reached the maximum level.

""Aaron and Wooi Yik are still adapting to my training programmes,"" he said as reported by Bernama.

The last time Malaysia won the All-England men's doubles title was in 2007, when Koo Kien Keat-Tan Boon Heong defeated China’s Fu Haifeng-Chai Yun in the final.

Herry however, may not get to go to the All-England due to visa issues.

Aaron-Wooi Yik’s best achievement at the All England was finishing as runners-up in the 2019 and 2024 editions.

Fans get to see a new side to Lalisa “Lisa” Manobal – or five new sides, to be precise – in a 56-page project inspired by her upcoming debut solo album, set for release under her own LLOUD record label on Feb 28.

The comic book shines a spotlight on five unique characters – Roxi, Kiki, Vixi, Sunni and Speedi – all different sides of the Thai star’s personality.

The visual story is brought to life by Japanese illustrator MinoMiyabi, who has helmed collaborations with artists like Gorillaz, Poppy and Yungblud.

Lisa is the latest artist to team up with comic publisher Zero Zero Entertainment, which has collaborated with everyone from Elvis Presley, Blondie and Weird Al Yankovic to K-pop group NCT 127.

Fans can pre-order “Alter-ego: The Official Comic”, priced 682 baht, at LalisaComics.com. The first issue is set to ship in March.

The “Rockstar” artist recently purchased a new Ferrari Purosangue SUV for around 40 million baht, parking it next to the Ferrari 812 model that she bought last year. Her growing supercar collection also features a Porsche 911 GT3 RS that she picked up for around 25 million baht.

This has been a year of debuts for the Blackpink star, who makes her acting bow in the third season of “The White Lotus”, set in her home country of Thailand.

1558914,Toxic metals found in certain protein powders,"Gym-goers can sometimes be seen clutching protein shakes as if in possession of a magic muscle-building elixir or a tin of Popeye’s spinach, gulping down mouthfuls between sets and furtive mirror glances.

But there is a 50-50 chance the powders used to make the shakes contain amounts of toxic metals deemed unsafe in some quarters.

That’s according to the Clean Label Project, whose mission, its executive director Jaclyn “Jackie” Bowen says, is “to uncover the hidden risks of environmental contaminants and toxins lurking in everyday products”.

The United States-based non-profit organisation said that it tested 160 products produced by 70 brands – equivalent to 83% of the US protein powder market – and found that 47% contained levels of metal exceeding the threshold in Prop 65, a California state law known officially as the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986.

Plant-based proteins were found to have higher levels of metals in them than whey powders, while chocolate-flavoured powders had four times as much lead as vanilla powders, and organic mixes had three times the amount of cadmium as whey powders.

If they don’t lead to people eating more chicken, eggs, fish and meat to get their protein, they should at least serve as “a wake-up call for consumers, manufacturers, retailers and regulators”, the Clean Label Project said, adding that there needs to be “stricter safety standards to protect consumers from long-term exposure to these contaminants”.

“Consumers are purchasing supplement and protein products for health and performance; they expect the products to be clean,” Bowen noted. – dpa",Lifestyle,2025-02-21,260

The Turtles will have to forget the service of influential Uzbekistani midfielder Nurillo Tukhtasinov (pic), dubbed the Mozart of the team, due to suspension.

The 28-year-old has collected three yellow cards and will have to miss the Super League tie against the Borneo side at the Sultan Mizan Stadium in Gong Badak today.

They will also play without mercurial winger Akhyar Rashid as he is sick.

Coach Badrul Afzan Razali said Akhyar had been having fever and diarrhoea the past few days.

“Our preparation has been hampered a little because we will not have our main midfielder, who is suspended,” said Badrul.

“Akram (Mahinan) could play in Nurillo’s role.”

Tukhtasinov is a regular for Terengganu, having played 33 games in all competitions, scoring five goals and making three assists.

His combination with Filipino international midfielder Manuel Ott in midfield has been superb and that’s why his absence would be felt.

Badrul will dip into his reserves list to find a replacement for Akhyar, who has played 31 games in all competitions, scoring nine goals.

External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar met with China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the sidelines of the Group of 20 foreign ministers’ summit in Johannesburg, their first in-person meeting since the G-20 summit in Rio de Janeiro in November.

""Such gatherings have provided an opportunity for our interaction even when our ties were going through a difficult phase,” Jaishankar said, according to a readout of the meeting.

""We should also recognize that in a polarized global situation, our two countries have worked hard to preserve and protect the G-20 as an institution. This in itself testifies to the importance of international cooperation.”

Relations between New Delhi and Beijing soured significantly in 2020 after a series of deadly border skirmishes, with India subsequently restricting visas and investment and banning Chinese smartphone apps.

The two nations began restoring ties last year and recently agreed to resume direct flights and facilitate visas for travel.

The Friday meeting lasted about 30 minutes and the two ministers discussed ""developments in bilateral relations since their last meeting in November, specifically management of peace and tranquility in the border areas, resumption of pilgrimage, trans-border rivers, flight connectivity and travel facilitation,” Randhir Jaiswal, spokesperson for India’s Ministry of External Affairs, told reporters on Friday.

They also exchanged views about the G-20 and Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, he said.

The G-20 meeting has been marred by the US’s snub of the event. Secretary of State Marco Rubio declined to attend this week’s meeting in protest at what he said was an attempt by South Africa to promote diversity, equity and inclusion, and tackle climate change.

1562796,Harvesting fog could combat water shortages in world’s driest regions,"SOUTH-EAST ASIA (dpa): Harvesting fog could ease water scarcity in the world's driest place, a new study has suggested.

In Chile's Atacama Desert, with less annual rainfall than 1 millimetre per year, the main water source is underground water-filled spaces which last recharged between 17,000 and 10,000 years ago.

So-called fog harvesting, where fog water is collected and saved, is a feasible way to provide much needed water, scientists said in a research published in Frontiers in Environmental Science.

In a year-long field study, scientists found it was possible to collect as much as 5 litres of water per square metre each day.

Co-author of the study Virginia Carter Gamberini said the research showed it was possible to scale up fog water use, ""from a rural, rather small-scale solution to a practical water resource for cities.""

""Our findings demonstrate that fog can serve as a complementary urban water supply in drylands where climate change exacerbates water shortages,"" she said.

""The collection and use of water, especially from non-conventional sources such as fog water, represents a key opportunity to improve the quality of life of inhabitants.""

Fog collectors typically consist of a mesh suspended between two posts. Water droplets collect on the mesh and fall into a gutter leading to water storage tanks.

Collected water could be used for drinking, irrigation, and local food production. However, researchers said large storage systems, piping infrastructure, and ways of distribution would still be required. - dpa",Politics,2025-02-21,242

The tariff is expected to take effect from March 7 and will be in place for 120 days, the ministry said in a statement seen by Reuters.

Among companies hit by the duties are Baoshan Iron & Steel and Maanshan Iron & Steel

Vietnam launched an anti-dumping investigation in July following complaints from Vietnamese producers.

China's ministries of commerce and foreign affairs did not immediately reply to faxed requests for comment after business hours.

Hanoi's move comes after the US administration announced 25% tariffs

on all its steel imports earlier this month, which would take effect on March 4.

The US already imposes anti-dumping duties on multiple Vietnamese steel exports and producers, in some cases even higher than 25%.

It is unclear whether US duties on Vietnam's steel would be applied on top of existing anti-dumping measures.

The pre-fabricated houses – made by Gebbia’s startup, Samara – will first go to low-income residents whose properties burned in Altadena and Pacific Palisades neighbourhoods, according to a statement.

The Samara homes can be built in as little as five months and require only weeks to install.

The homes will be 100% funded, including installation costs. The effort is being coordinated by Steadfast LA, a non-profit started by billionaire mall developer Rick Caruso to help rebuild the city.

“This initiative is about keeping communities intact,” said Caruso, whose family foundation will also provide funding for the housing.

“We’re giving these victims a realistic way to stay on their properties and quickly return to their lives at a time when the deck is stacked against them.”

Last month’s wildfires killed at least 29 people and destroyed 16,000 structures, including 11,000 single-family homes. Economists at the University of California at Los Angeles estimated this month that total property and capital losses from the fires will be as much as US$164bil.

Gebbia, 43, joined Tesla’s board in 2022 and is worth US$9.7bil, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

The New York Times reported last week he is joining Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE, which is aggressively cutting government jobs, spending and contracts under President Donald Trump.

Gebbia launched Samara soon after leaving Airbnb full-time in 2022. The company builds and sells affordable, small homes for installation in backyards.

“Our hearts go out to all the individuals, families, and communities impacted by these destructive wildfires,” Gebbia said in the statement. — Bloomberg",Business,2025-02-21,294
1562144,"Singapore’s car permits, wealth funds help surplus","Singapore: The Singapore government sourced billions of dollars more than it initially expected from the auction of near-record high car permits, income tax and contributions from its state wealth funds, according to budget data released on Tuesday.

The financial hub’s national budget showed that vehicle quota premiums brought in S$6.54bil or about US$5bil for the city-state last year, which was S$1.82bil more than the Finance Ministry initially expected.

The revenue helped drive the country’s budget into a surplus last year.

Singapore is also expecting a surplus of S$6.81 billion for this year, surprising economists who have expected 0.3% of GDP deficit as the ruling party pledges voucher giveaways ahead of a national election.

Vehicle quota premiums have become a key source of revenue for the government, derived largely from the auction of certificates of entitlement.

All car owners in the country must bid for these permits to be allowed to drive their car for a maximum of 10 years – a rule that means a Toyota Camry sedan in Singapore can cost almost as much as an Aston Martin Vantage in New York.

While the government has pledged to release more of these permits – which now cost around S$110,000 for larger sedans, it estimates vehicle quota premium revenues will hit a record of S$6.6bil this year.

The Finance Ministry has recorded more from this avenue than originally expected from three of the past five years, according to a review of prior budgets.

The amount being drawn from Singapore’s state wealth funds and the central bank is also hitting record highs.

Last year, the Singapore government got S$24bil from Net Investment Returns Contribution, S$520mil more than estimated a year earlier. That trend is expected to continue, with a forecast increase of 13% to S$27.1bil this year.

The Net Investment Returns Contribution represents as much as half of the net investment income and up to half of the long-term expected real returns of Temasek Holdings Pte, GIC Pte and the Monetary Authority of Singapore.

Personal income tax collected grew by 8.3% to nearly S$19bil from a year ago. — Bloomberg",Business,2025-02-21,349

1562738,Cambodia to resume demining after US aid waiver,"PHNOM PENH (AFP): Cambodian deminers are to resume operations to clear unexploded munitions, after the United States granted a waiver to keep funding the work in the country, officials said on Friday.

Cambodia remains littered with unexploded bombs, many of which were dropped by American forces during the Vietnam War.

Cambodia was forced to partially suspend demining operations from late January after Washington suddenly halted funding following President Donald Trump's order to freeze foreign aid for 90 days.

Heng Ratana, director general of the Cambodian Mine Action Centre (CMAC), told AFP on Friday that the US had granted a conditional waiver for funding to partner organisations supporting Cambodia's demining projects.

He said he had sent deminers, who had been standing down for the past several weeks, back to the field and that operations to clear unexploded munitions would resume on Monday.

""We are happy to resume our mission to save lives,"" Keo Sarath, manager of CMAC's demining unit 5 headquarters, which is responsible for clearing along eastern provinces bordering Vietnam.

The United States has been a ""key partner"" and provided around $10 million a year to fund mine clearance in Cambodia.

Ly Thuch, a senior government minister and leading official in Cambodia's Mine Action Authority, confirmed the US embassy had informed the foreign ministry about the continuation of demining funding.

He said deminers would soon be able to resume full-scale operations.

During the Vietnam War, then-US president Richard Nixon ordered a clandestine bombing campaign over large swathes of Laos and Cambodia, which helped fuel the rise of the Khmer Rouge.

After more than 30 years of civil war ended in 1998, Cambodia was left as one of the most heavily mined countries in the world.

Deaths from the war remnants are still common, with around 20,000 people killed since 1979, and twice that number wounded.

More than 1,600 square kilometres (620 square miles) of contaminated land still needs to be cleared in Cambodia.

Cambodia had aimed to be mine-free by 2025, but the government pushed the deadline back by five years because of funding challenges and new landmine fields found along the Thai border. - AFP",Politics,2025-02-21,356

The Sinopharm vaccine had been earlier approved for use by private clinics in Singapore against the Covid-19 virus.

The trio’s trial will resume on March 4.

Separately, Ng, 51, was handed 12 cheating charges involving nearly $61,000 on Feb 7.

In 2019 and 2020, he allegedly committed multiple counts of cheating linked to a company called Vendshare that dealt with vending machines.

There were 12 alleged victims, and around $60,800 in total was involved. The amounts ranged between $1,000 and $13,900 per person.

Between Aug 25 and Dec 25 in 2019, Ng allegedly cheated a man by duping him into believing payments made to Vendshare were for the co-ownership of coffee vending machines.

Ng is a former director at the firm. According to court documents, Ng purportedly dishonestly induced the man to make payments totalling $2,500 to Vendshare.

Ng allegedly cheated 11 other people by using a similar method.

One of the men, who was purportedly duped between November 2019 and June 2020, was allegedly cheated of $13,900 – the largest amount.

Ng’s case will be mentioned again in court on March 7. - The Straits Times/ANN",Politics,2025-02-21,333
1562340,Philippines makes first frozen durian shipment to China,"MANILA: The Philippines expanded its presence in the global market by making its first frozen durian shipment to China valued at P8.2 million (US$0.14 million).

In a statement on Thursday (Feb 20), the Department of Agriculture (DA) said Davao City-based company Maylong Enterprises Corp. delivered 1,050 boxes of frozen durian meat and 300 boxes of durian paste to Nansha District in Guangzhou.

Maylong Enterprises became the first Philippine enterprise that secure the approval of the General Administration of Customs of the People’s Republic of China to supply frozen durian meat and paste to its country.

A previous report from the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations noted that China has been the main driver of global durian exports, as the East Asian country consumes more than 90 per cent of durian supply worldwide.

The DA said the shipment of durian, also known as king of fruits marked a “key moment” for the agriculture sector. It was shipped on Feb. 11 and is expected to arrive on Feb. 18.

“This historic shipment strengthens the Philippines’ presence in international markets, opening the door to future growth and solidifying the country’s reputation as a leading producer of world-class durian,” the DA said.

The Davao Region is the leading domestic producer of durian and accounts for more than two-thirds of total production based on the latest government data available.

“From the fertile soils of Davao Region to China’s bustling markets, our frozen durian represents the hopes and dreams of countless farmers,” said Macario Gonzaga, DA Region XI executive director. - Philippine Daily Inquirer/ANN",Politics,2025-02-21,261

1562430,Philippine police arrest over 450 in 'Chinese-run' scam centre raid,"MANILA: Philippine police arrested more than 450 people in a raid on an allegedly Chinese-run offshore gaming operator in Manila, the country's anti-organised crime commission has said.

Initial interrogations suggested the suburban site had been operating as a scam centre, targeting victims in China and India with sports betting and investment schemes, the commission said after the Thursday (Feb 20) raid, which saw 137 Chinese nationals detained.

""We arrested around five Chinese bosses,"" said commission chief Gilberto Cruz on Friday, adding they faced potential trafficking charges.

Banned by President Ferdinand Marcos last year, Philippine online gaming operators, or Pogos, are said to be used as cover by organised crime groups for human trafficking, money laundering, online fraud, kidnappings and even murder.

""This raid proves that the previous Pogo workers are still trying to continue their scamming activities despite the ban,"" Cruz said.

He previously told AFP that about 21,000 Chinese nationals have continued to operate smaller-scale scam operations in the country since the online gaming ban.

International concern has grown in recent years over similar scam operations in other Asian nations that are often staffed by trafficking victims tricked or coerced into promoting bogus cryptocurrency investments and other cons.

President Marcos has put Pogos at the centre of recent campaign messaging in the run-up to May mid-term elections, framing predecessor Rodrigo Duterte's alleged tolerance of the sites as evidence of a too-cozy relationship with China.

Thursday's raid is the latest in a series of busts this year, including one in January that saw around 400 foreigners arrested in the capital, including many Chinese nationals.

The Washington-based think tank United States Institute of Peace said in a May 2024 report that online scammers target millions of victims around the world and rake in annual revenues of US$64 billion. - AFP",Politics,2025-02-21,299

A group of 200 Chinese citizens suspected of involvement in call centre fraud returned to China on Thursday under the escort of Chinese police after being repatriated from Myawaddy in Myanmar, the report said.

The suspects were first sent to Thailand's Mae Sot district in Tak province, which shares a border with Myawaddy, before being flown back to China on four chartered flights. They arrived at an airport in Nanjing, the capital of eastern Jiangsu province.

The ministry added that more than 800 other fraud suspects are expected to be repatriated in the coming days.

According to the ministry, law enforcement authorities from the three countries recently launched a joint telecom fraud operation in Myawaddy.

Thailand has cut off electricity, internet and fuel supplies to Myawaddy, and strengthened patrols to prevent illegal border crossings by individuals involved in scams, it said.

Myanmar, meanwhile, has deployed forces to raid telecom fraud compounds in Myawaddy, arrested fraud suspects, and rescued Chinese nationals trapped in scam operations, it added.

The ministry also vowed to continue to dismantle telecom fraud compounds and effectively safeguard the lives and property of Chinese citizens.

On Wednesday, Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said that the clampdown operation at Thai-Myanmar border has resulted in electricity consumption in the relevant areas in Myanmar decreasing by 40%.

Its chairman Datuk Katherin Lee said while efforts were being done to create more awareness on this matter, the fact is that there are still many challenges for these people to get back into the community due to stigma.

She said this applies also to those who are released on licence, meaning those that are still serving their jail sentence but, outside, with restrictions and regulations in place.

“We see many who are released under licence are facing tough times trying to secure jobs, places to live and to readjust to life in the community,” she said in a statement after paying a courtesy call to the Yang di-Pertua Negeri Sabah Tun Musa Aman, Thursday (Feb 20).

There are also many whose families have disowned them, making it even harder for these people to move on and try to be better in life, Lee said.

She said other than families, private and government sectors can consider playing bigger roles in hiring ex-convicts so that at least, they have a chance to turn over a new leave, rebuild their lives and never have to sort to criminal acts anymore.

“We want these people to contribute to the society, country and their family,” she stressed.

Lee suggested some form of incentive programme to be introduced and enforced here, just like the one in Singapore where employers who hire former inmates get incentives and salary subsidies.

The centre was verifying reports on social media that Thailand’s temperature during this summer could rise to 42 or 43°C with data from the Thai Meteorological Department.

The centre said that on Feb 6, the department forecast that the summer season this year will see extreme heat in some parts of Thailand, with temperature rising to 42 or 43°C from late March until mid-April.

However, before and after this period Thailand will see lower temperatures, the department added.

From early to mid-March, upper Thailand will experience hot days and thick fog in some areas, the department said.

However, the North and the Northeast will still experience cool temperatures in the morning due to the high-pressure system from China intermittently covering these regions, though it will be relatively weak.

From the end of March to mid-April, a low-pressure area will intermittently cover upper Thailand, while the southeasterly or southerly winds will bring moisture from the Gulf of Thailand, resulting in hot and humid weather in most of Thailand, with the highest temperatures reaching 42 to 43°C.

There will also be occasional summer storms, gusty winds, and possibly hail in some areas, which will help alleviate the heat, the department added.

As Thailand enters the transition period between seasons from mid-April to mid-May, there will be intermittent hot and humid conditions, with increasing thunderstorms.

This is due to the southeasterly or southerly winds that have been covering the upper country starting to shift to the southwest monsoon, the department said. - The Nation/ANN",Politics,2025-02-21,289

1562205,Elephants take fatal hit,"A passenger train derailed after smashing into a family of elephants, with no passengers injured but six animals killed in the island’s worst such wildlife accident, police said.

The express train was travelling near a wildlife reserve at Habarana, some 180km east of the capital Colombo, when it hit the herd crossing the line before dawn yesterday.

“The train derailed, but there were no casualties among the passengers,” police said, adding that wildlife authorities were treating two elephants who survived the crash.

Videos shot after the accident showed one elephant standing guard over an injured youngster lying beside the tracks, with the tips of their trunks curled together.

Killing or harming elephants is a criminal offence in Sri Lanka, with the animals considered a national treasure, partly due to their significance in Buddhist culture.

Two baby elephants and their pregnant mother were killed in a similar accident by a train in the same area in September 2018.

Since then, the authorities ordered train drivers to observe speed limits to minimise injury to elephants when going through areas where they cross the lines.

The elephant deaths come days after the authorities expressed concern over the growing impact of conflict between humans and elephants, as the ancient habitat of the animals is increasingly encroached upon.

Farmers scratching a living from smallholder plots often fight back against elephants raiding their crops.

Deputy Environment Minister Anton Jayakody said last Sunday that 150 people and 450 elephants were killed in clashes in 2023.

That is an increase on the previous year, when 145 people and 433 elephants were killed, according to official data.

Just those two years represent more than a tenth of the island’s elephants.

But Jayakody said he was confident the government could find solutions.

1562202,‘Ousted president sought to stop dictatorship’,"Ousted South Korean leader Yoon Suk Yeol’s lawyer yesterday said his bid to impose martial law was aimed at thwarting a “legislative dictatorship” by the opposition-controlled parliament, as the president became the country’s first sitting head of state to stand trial in a criminal case.

The 64-year-old former prosecutor has been behind bars since he was arrested last month on charges of insurrection, for which he could be sentenced to life in prison or face the death penalty.

Criminal proceedings at Seoul’s Central District Court yesterday morning lasted just over an hour.

Yoon attended the hearing but did not speak, a journalist in the packed courtroom said.

There was heavy security around the building, with Yonhap news agency reporting police mobilised around 3,200 personnel to the site.

Prosecutors have accused the suspended president of being the “ringleader of an insurrection”.

They argued against releasing him from the detention facility where he has been held since mid-January, saying Yoon could try to “influence or persuade those involved in the case”.

Addressing the court, Yoon’s lawyer Kim Hong-il in turn condemned the “illegal probe”, arguing the “investigating body has no jurisdiction”.

“The declaration of martial law was not intended to paralyse the state,” Kim said.

Instead, he said, it was meant to “alert the public to the national crisis caused by the legislative dictatorship of the dominant opposition party, which had crippled the administration”.

“The judiciary must serve as the stabilising force,” he told the court’s three judges, warning that he was “witnessing a reality where illegality compounds illegality”.

Separately, South Korea’s Constitutional Court is deliberating whether to formally remove Yoon from office following his impeachment by parliament in December.

If Yoon is removed from office, the country must hold fresh presidential elections within 60 days.

Much of Yoon’s impeachment trial has centred on the question of whether he violated the constitution by declaring martial law, which is reserved for national emergencies or times of war.

His decree only lasted around six hours as the opposition-led parliament defied troops to vote it down. — AFP",Politics,2025-02-21,343
1562201,Scam workers return home,"Hundreds of Chinese workers were heading home yesterday after being returned from online scam centres in Myanmar, as authorities crack down on the illegal operations.

Thousands of foreigners are expected to be freed and returned from scam compounds in Myanmar in coming weeks, starting with 600 Chinese nationals over the next three days.

The compounds run by criminal gangs are staffed by foreigners, many who say they were trafficked and forced to work running internet scams swindling people around the world.

Many of those involved are Chinese, and Beijing has stepped up pressure on Myanmar and Thailand to shut the centres down.

Two double-decker coaches delivered a first group of workers across the border from Myanmar onto the tarmac of an airport in the western Thai town of Mae Sot yesterday morning.

Dozens of people, seemingly all men, boarded a special China Southern Airlines plane directly from the buses, mounting the steps after being checked by an official with a clipboard.

1562199,Northern Japan snowed under after two-week whiteout,"Residents in the north are sheltering from deep snow up to the rooftops in some areas after a two-week whiteout.

Several cities have seen record snowfall this month, causing traffic disruption and several fatalities.

And more is expected, according to the national weather agency, which issued a series of warnings in recent days for heavy snow and strong winds, particularly along the Sea of Japan coast facing Russia and the Korea penin­sula.

“I have been here for 10 years, and I have never seen anything like this,” a resident of the remote Sukayu area of the Aomori region told TV network TBS in comments broadcast yesterday.

“If you look at the volume of snowfall per day, there wasn’t any single stand-out episode. But it accumulated little by little,” he said.

Sukayu is buried under 5m of snow, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency, reaching the roofs of two-storey buildings.

“We may see a warning-level snowstorm, if snow clouds stay in the same location,” the agency’s Aomori unit said in a bulletin yesterday.

Meanwhile, in the streets of Tsunan town in Niigata, more than 3.5m of snow has piled up.

At one Niigata ski resort last week, holidaymakers delighted in and sometimes struggled with all the fresh powder on the slopes, while heavy-duty road maintenance vehicles and hotel owners were busy clearing snow from dawn until dusk.

Hundreds of vehicles have been stranded for hours at ­various spots along snow-covered highways in recent days.

Aomori has counted at least nine deaths linked to snow this winter, including six people who were shovelling it from rooftops. Niigata has seen at least 12 snow-related deaths.

Three workers at a secluded mountain resort in the Fukushima region were found dead on Tuesday after they apparently trekked across a snowy mountain for maintenance work at the source of a hot spring, local media reported.

Police are reportedly investiga­ting whether the deaths were linked to high concentrations of toxic hydrogen sulfide gas that is known to exist around the volca­nic region.

Piles of snow could have trapped the gas at the hot spring’s source, the reports said. — AFP",Politics,2025-02-21,353

Immigration director-general Datuk Zakaria Shaaban said the raids were conducted at upscale condominiums, where the centres were located, at around 11.30am on Wednesday.

“Those detained were 14 male Chinese nationals, 15 men and four women from Indonesia, a man and two women from Myanmar, two Bangladeshi men, two women from Laos and six Thai women.

“Those detained are aged between 23 and 54,” he said.

Various items were seized including four laptops, 88 mobile phones, 26 SIM cards and RM100,000 cash, he said.

“We carried out intelligence for three weeks before raiding the residential units.

“The scammers were renting the units,” he added.

Zakaria said the scammers would dupe victims by “selling” stock shares, gold and property online.

“They used social media and chat applications such as Facebook, TikTok, WhatsApp and Telegram to lure victims.

“They not only targeted locals but also foreigners from their respective home countries.

“We believe they also operated bogus online gambling,” he said.

Zakaria added that the suspects would send offers for the items directly to the victims’ mobile phones at random.

“When the victims show interest, they were required to transfer funds to an account given by the syndicate.

“The victims realised they had been duped when the seller could not be reached after the money was transferred,” he said.

“Each syndicate member is paid between RM2,500 and RM3,500 monthly.”

1562439,China's military says it drove away Philippine aircraft near Spratly Islands,"BEIJING: China's military said it warned and drove away three Philippine aircraft that ""illegally intruded"" into the airspace near the Spratly Islands on Thursday (Feb 20).

There was no immediate comment from the Philippine embassy in Beijing on the Chinese military's statement issued on Friday.

China's Southern Theatre Command accused the Philippine side of attempting to ""peddle its illegal claims"" through provocation, and warned that the ""clumsy manoeuvre is doomed to failure"".

China claims sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea, a vital waterway for more than US$3 trillion of annual ship-borne commerce, putting it at odds with Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam.

A 2016 arbitration ruling invalidated China's expansive claim but Beijing does not recognise the decision.

On Thursday, the Philippines said its coast guard and fisheries bureau had jointly carried out a maritime domain awareness flight over the Kalayaan Islands, the Philippine name for Spratly Islands.

The mission was to assert the Philippines' sovereignty, sovereign rights, and maritime jurisdiction in the West Philippine Sea, it said.

More than 50 Chinese maritime militia vessels and a Chinese coast guard ship were spotted during the exercise.

It was not immediately clear if that mission, which deployed two aircraft, was the one Chinese military said it responded to.

The latest confrontation comes after Philippine coast guard accused the Chinese navy of performing dangerous flight manoeuvres earlier this week when it flew close to a government aircraft patrolling the contested Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea.

Beijing disputed that account. - Reuters",Politics,2025-02-21,254

In the capital, students called on the president to review his US$30-billion free meal program and cancel the $19-billion planned spending cuts, among other demands, according to a widely circulated statement.

They banded together under the ""Dark Indonesia” movement spread on social media.

Opposition is growing against Prabowo’s call for ""budget efficiency” that’s reminiscent of the deep spending cuts that are happening both in Vietnam and in the US, spearheaded by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE.

Authorities blocked a major road in the city center for the planned protest, while protesters knocked down police barriers late in the afternoon, according to local news reports.

State Secretary Prasetyo Hadi made an appearance in the rally in a bid to quell the protests. Another demonstration, involving civil society groups, is scheduled for Friday.

Students also rallied in Medan, one of the nation’s most populous cities, and in Yogyakarta. Televised footage showed hundreds of protesters in each location.

Prabowo, whose popularity was at record highs in January, doubled down on the austerity drive earlier this month, calling his critics ""little kings” who think they are immune to the law.

The budget uncertainty is adding to global trade tensions and soft economic growth that have made the Indonesian rupiah and benchmark stock index among Asia’s worst performers this year.

The rupiah has weakened 1.4% against the US dollar to-date, while the Jakarta Composite Index has shed 4.1%.

In a statement, the DND said the final negotiating round for the Status of Visiting Forces Agreement (SOVFA) was hosted by New Zealand via a hybrid arrangement.

The talks were concluded less than a month after the first round was held last Jan. 23 in Manila.

“After finalising the text of the agreement, both sides expressed optimism toward the signing of the Agreement in the second quarter of 2025,” the DND said.

In a joint statement in January, the DND and the New Zealand embassy in Manila said a visiting forces deal would deepen the overall defence and military cooperation between the two countries.

Defence Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr. (pic) told reporters early this month that the agreement was important for both countries’ initiative “to resist China’s unilateral narrative to change international law.”

Teodoro was referring to Beijing’s expansive claims in the South China Sea despite a 2016 arbitral ruling, invalidating its sweeping claims in the resource-rich waterway.

“The VFA with New Zealand will be very important for us for that purpose, and secondly, for disaster risk reduction purposes and humanitarian assistance and disaster response,” he said.

New Zealand’s ambassador to the Philippines, Catherine McIntosh, also told reporters this month that Wellington has a “strong political commitment” to seal the deal with Manila.

The Philippines has a SOVFA with Australia, a Visiting Forces Agreement with the United States, and a Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA) with Japan.

The Commercial Crime Investigation Department's (CCID) Cyber Tactical Unit of the Operation and Intelligence Division spearheaded the operation after months of intelligence gathering, which began in October last year.

The latest rate is far below the half of Americans with passports, a level that has soared from around five per cent in 1990.

As of December 2024, there were 21.6 million valid Japanese passports in circulation, representing around 17.5 per cent of the overall population, the foreign ministry said on Thursday (Feb 20).

Before the Covid-19 pandemic, about a quarter of Japanese people owned valid passports.

The country's travel document is tied with neighbour South Korea's passport as the world's second strongest after Singapore, allowing visa-free entry to 190 destinations, according to this year's Henley Passport Index.

Outbound travel from Japan has gradually resumed after the quarantine measures and border closures of the pandemic era, according to the ministry.

But the weakness of the yen -- which has shed a third of its value in the past five years -- is one factor deterring Japanese travellers along with inflation and a renewed interest in domestic travel, analysts say.

The new data comes as the nation welcomes a record influx of tourists from other countries, with more than 36 million visits recorded last year and many flocking to hotspots like Kyoto.

International travel by Japanese nationals began to increase sharply in the boom years of the late 1980s.

1562567,South Korean President Yoon booked on suspicion of obstruction of arrest warrant,"SEOUL: South Korean police have booked President Yoon Suk-yeol on suspicion of obstructing the execution of a warrant issued to detain him in January, officials said Friday (Feb 21).

Yoon, who was impeached and suspended from office after his controversial imposition of martial law on Dec 3, 2024, is suspected of instructing the Presidential Security Service to prevent investigative authorities from detaining him with regard to a criminal investigation over insurrection charges.

The president had already been booked on the same charges of hindering special official duties on Jan 3 via a complaint filed by the Rebuilding Korea Party, a minor opposition party. However, as sitting president, Yoon cannot be prosecuted criminally except for insurrection or treason.

Accusations against Yoon of interfering with an arrest warrant were included in the initial request for a detention warrant for Kim Sung-hoon, the vice chief of the Presidential Security Service who is also accused of interfering with special official duties.

After being impeached in a vote by the National Assembly on Dec 14, Yoon was arrested for insurrection on Jan 15 by officials from the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials, making him the first sitting president to be taken into custody.

Following the 10th hearing in Yoon’s impeachment trial at the Constitutional Court on Thursday, the court announced it would hold the 11th and final hearing the following Tuesday.

After the final hearing, the verdict to conclude Yoon’s trial is expected to be announced in mid-March.

Spot gold shed 0.4% to $2,927.89 an ounce by 0501 GMT. Bullion has added more than 1% so far this week, rising to an all-time high of $2,954.69 on Thursday.

U.S. gold futures fell 0.5% to $2,942.

""Gold has been displaying resilience with short-lived retracements, as lingering U.S. trade uncertainties reinforce its appeal as a hedge,"" IG market strategist Yeap Jun Rong said.

""Buyers seem to be eyeing the psychological $3,000 level seriously, and it seems hard to go against the broader upward trend.""

Earlier this week, Trump said he will announce fresh tariffs over the next month or sooner, adding lumber and forest products to previously announced plans to impose duties on imported cars, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals.

Since taking office on January 20, Trump has imposed an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports and a 25% tariff on steel and aluminium.

U.S. Federal Reserve officials are taking note of what they see as rising inflationary risks and the uncertain impact of Trump's trade, immigration, and other policies.

Fed Governor Adriana Kugler said on Thursday that given the balance of risks it is appropriate to hold the federal funds rate in place for some time.

Bullion is seen as a safeguard against geopolitical risks and inflation, but higher interest rates dampen the non-yielding asset's appeal.

“The performance of MAHB shares had surpassed the performance of the Kuala Lumpur Composite Index (KLCI) by 11.47% and was a factor for this strategy,” he said in reply to a question raised by Chong Zhemin (PH-Kampar) in the Dewan Rakyat yesterday.

“It needs to be stressed that the evaluation and discussion for the Voluntary General Offer (VGO) only began in July 2023.

Global waste trade watchdog group Basel Action Network researcher Wong Pui Yi said a large part of the illegal e-waste processing industry involves foreign smuggled e-waste.

She said e-waste, shipped from other parts of the world to Malaysia, is crudely processed by smashing and burning.

“The illegal operators do not need to pay for business licences, fair wages for workers or adhere to pollution controls.”

E-waste materials are also difficult to process thoroughly without significant expenditure to contain pollution, said Wong.

She said e-waste could release “extremely toxic” chemicals of up to 1,000 chemicals including brominated flame retar­dants, polychlorinated biphe­nyls and heavy metals into the environment.

One of the chemicals – Persistent Organic Pollutant – can accumulate in the body and damage metabolic systems, the brain and reproductive systems.

“This is very dangerous, especially to pregnant women and children, as it can lead to irreversible health effects, including cancers, miscarriages, neurological damage and diminished IQ.”

Environment and waste management specialist Dr Theng Lee Chong said illegal e-waste operators were operating unchecked.

He said this left operators frustrated as illegal factories grow unchecked while licensed ones faced regular inspections.

The amendment to the Environ­mental Quality Act 1974 last year has increased penalty amounts and imprisonment, which should have stronger impact in deterring illegal waste, he said.

He said there should be stricter controls by Customs Department in checking on illegal e-waste shipments entering the country.

Theng suggested developing a special portal for the public to report illegal factory operations, to be managed by multiple authorities and NGOs.

He said while e-waste from industries is well-regulated in Malaysia, household e-waste such as televisions is not.

“The Natural Resources and Environmental Sustainability Minister has said that a new regulation to address non-industrial sources will be enacted in 2025.”

Sahabat Alam Malaysia honorary secretary Mageswari Sangara-lingam said illegal e-waste trade and e-waste processing and recycling facilities, driven by the extraction of metals such as copper and gold, are rampant.

Her family paid over two million rupees in dowry during her wedding to Sandeep Budholia in 2019. But his family had reportedly continued to demand more dowry, stopping only after the woman’s father filed a police report.

The couple had three daughters, and Sandeep’s family was reportedly unhappy, blaming his wife for not having any sons.

All of this led to him allegedly beating his wife to death and staging the scene as though his wife took her own life.

State women and family empowerment, social welfare and care economy committee chairman Anfaal Saari said those rescued from the streets were returned to their kin or guardians and eligible individuals would be provided with monthly financial assistance.

Based on 199 operations organised by the state Welfare Department, she said 155 destitute persons comprising 102 locals and 53 foreigners were rescued off the streets as of December last year.

“For cases without relatives or guardians, they will be placed in welfare institutions or non-governmental organisation care centres.

“The Welfare Department will refer cases of non-citizen destitute people to the Immigration Department for further action.

“However, the state government does not plan to establish a one-stop centre or a homeless transit centre in Selangor,” she said at the Selangor State Assembly sitting in Shah Alam.

She was replying to a question by Cheong Kian Young (PH-Kajang) on whether a one-stop centre would be established to address homelessness in the state.

Anfaal said Selangor Welfare Department temporarily placed rescued destitute people at Kompleks Penyayang Bakti Sungai Buloh.

To address the issue of homelessness, the Welfare Department had taken in people through operations conducted in a coordinated, periodic or ad-hoc manner based on public complaints, said Anfaal.

Separately, Anfaal said the setting up of a special committee to improve care services in the state was in support of the Selangor Care Economy Policy.

The committee set up last year reviews, assesses and improves guidelines related to care services for children, the elderly and persons with disabilities.

Anfaal said this in response to a supplementary question on the progress of the Selangor Care Economy Policy from Pua Pei Ling (PH-Bukit Lanjan).

Selangor had also implemented its care centre grant to encourage operators of daycare centres, elderly care centres and facilities for persons with disabilities to register with the relevant authorities, said Anfaal.

“The RM5,000 grant aims to cover the operator’s registration costs including building plans, modifications and compliance with technical agencies.

“Application for the grant is open throughout the year, with a total of RM400,000 set aside,” she added.",Metro,2025-02-21,360

“To successfully host Sukma, the estimated budget is RM250mil.

“This would cover costs such as secretariat management, athlete preparation, technical equipment setup, competition equipment, cost for the sports village inclusive of food and beverage, information and communication technology systems, logistics, transportation, security and competition venue.

“However, to cover the high cost of organising this event, the state government believes there will be sponsorship from government-linked and private companies,” he said during the Selangor State Assembly sitting at Bangunan Dewan Negeri Selangor in Shah Alam yesterday.

He was replying to a question raised by Michelle Ng (PH-Subang Jaya) on the Sukma budget.

Mohd Najwan said that lack of a main venue to host the games was Selangor’s biggest challenge.

“Phase One of Shah Alam Sports Complex (KSSA) is only expected to be completed by mid-2027.

“In addition, the preparation time for Sukma in Selangor is short – less than two years – compared to previous host states who had a longer preparation period of between four and six years before hosting the games,” he said.

To address the challenge, he said existing competition venues had been identified for use during the event.

“There is no need to build new sports infrastructure, as it is more efficient and cost-effective if all competition venues only underwent upgrades and improvements to ensure they meet the established standards,” he said.",Metro,2025-02-21,248

1562278,Why have thousands of applications vanished from Europe's App Store?,"Apple is starting to remove applications from its App Store in Europe in order to comply with EU legislation on digital services, which requires developers to provide precise contact information.

Over the past few days, the Cupertino-based tech firm has been carrying out a major clean-up operation in the App Stores of European Union member states, removing numerous applications that do not comply with the new requirements of the Digital Services Act (DSA). This legislation aims to strengthen transparency and accountability of developers regarding European users.

The European Digital Services Act is a piece of legislation adopted in October 2022, designed to create a safer and more transparent online environment for all Internet users. As far as online stores like Apple's App Store are concerned, the DSA imposes several obligations, starting with full transparency for app publishers. Developers must declare their trader status and provide precise contact information, such as a postal address, telephone number and email address. If this is not the case, Apple can remove their creations from its store.

Apple has already begun to remove applications whose developers have not provided the information required by the DSA from the App Store throughout the EU. More than 100,000 applications are said to be affected.

For European users, this means no future updates for applications that no longer appear in the App Store, which could quickly lead to security problems. However, this initiative is aimed above all at protecting users by ensuring that the applications available all meet high standards of transparency and accountability.

Note that Google is also required to comply with the same European legislation for its Play Store. – AFP Relaxnews",Tech,2025-02-21,275
1561489,Hackers have found a way to bypass two-factor authentication,"Hackers have developed a phishing kit capable of bypassing two-factor authentication systems, previously considered to be one of the most secure ways of protecting access to online accounts.

Two-factor authentication, which involves providing additional information (usually a code sent by email or SMS) in addition to a traditional password to log into an online service, is a recommended security measure to protect access to your most sensitive accounts. Unfortunately, this solution, which seemed to be an invincible barrier against hackers, is now being undermined by a phishing tool called Astaroth, named after the Great Duke of Hell.

Cybersecurity specialist SlashNext was the first to spot this new tool, capable of bypassing two-factor authentication on Google, Microsoft and Yahoo accounts. To achieve this, the hackers send a fraudulent link to users, directing them to a fake login page perfectly imitating the real interface of the targeted platform. When users enter their login details and secret code, this information is immediately captured and misappropriated by the cybercriminals.

What makes Astaroth particularly dangerous is its ability to intercept two-factor authentication codes in real time. According to SlashNext, the complete kit is sold on the Dark Web for US$2,000 (RM8,855).

To protect yourself against this type of attack, you should, as always, be highly vigilant and avoid clicking on suspicious links from unknown senders. It's also advisable to use other, even more secure authentication methods, such as passkeys, which allow you to log in without a password, using a fingerprint, facial recognition or a code stored on the device. This is possible with Apple, Google and Microsoft. – AFP Relaxnews",Tech,2025-02-21,266

1562721,Elderly haj pilgrims reminded to get Covid-19 vaccine,"KUALA LUMPUR: Haj pilgrims aged 65 and above, as well as those identified as high-risk through health screenings, are reminded to get the COVID-19 vaccine free of charge at 247 selected health clinics nationwide from Feb 17.

Lembaga Tabung Haji (TH) chief executive officer Syed Hamadah Syed Othman advised pilgrims to schedule an appointment through the MySejahtera application from Feb 14 or via TH’s official website.

""A day before the vaccination date, an appointment reminder will be sent via MySejahtera to ensure pilgrims do not miss their vaccination session,” he said.

Syed Hamadah said pilgrims who were not in the mandatory category but wanted additional protection could opt for voluntary vaccination after consulting a medical officer at designated health facilities.

""Pilgrims seeking extra protection are highly encouraged to take the pneumococcal vaccine, which can be administered together with the influenza vaccine, as pneumococcal disease is a leading cause of hospitalisation among them,” he said.

On Feb 15, the Health Ministry announced that all prospective haj pilgrims were required to receive the meningococcal vaccine, while Covid-19 and influenza vaccines were mandatory for targeted groups.

Covid-19 is not just a common cold, as it can lead to serious complications, particularly among the elderly and those with chronic illnesses such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, asthma, and chronic lung conditions.

The side effects of the vaccine are generally mild and temporary, including slight pain at the injection site, fatigue, or a mild fever.

However, those with chronic illnesses such as diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, asthma, or chronic lung disease are at higher risk of severe Covid-19, which may require hospital treatment.

With the introduction of digital vaccination certificates, prospective pilgrims no longer need to bring physical vaccination books or cards when travelling to the Holy Land.

All vaccination certificates can be downloaded via the MySejahtera application and presented to the Saudi Arabian authorities when required.

According to Syed Hamadah, the digitalisation of health services demonstrated TH’s commitment to continuous improvements in assisting haj pilgrims.- Bernama",Others,2025-02-21,334

The Ayer Hitam MP referenced several news reports that said EPF made RM63.48bil in profits after selling the shares two years ago, which he said was untrue.

“I am concerned that this misinformation may spread, leading some to believe that the RM63.48bil profit came from selling MAHB shares in 2023.

“This figure is clearly illogical, as MAHB’s total assets are only estimated at around RM18bil,” he said in a Facebook post on Friday (Feb 21).

On Thursday (Feb 20), Finance Minister II Datuk Seri Amir Hamzah Azizan said that MAHB shares were sold at between RM6.80 to RM7.70 per unit, generating RM102mil for the EPF 2023 dividend distribution.

He said MAHB shares outperformed the Kuala Lumpur Composite Index by 11.47% in 2023, a key factor in the share sale strategy.

Dr Wee said that RM63.48bil figures cited by some media reports were actually referring to EPF’s total investment profit for the year.

“I was in the Dewan Rakyat when Amir Hamzah responded. He stated that EPF made a profit of RM102mil from selling MAHB shares in 2023.

“He also mentioned the figure of RM63.48bil as EPF’s total investment profit for 2023, meaning this was the profit from all of EPF’s investments, not just from selling MAHB shares.

Dr Wee said this following calls from the Pakatan Harapan’s youth wing for EPF’s management to sue him.

“This gives us a chance to reveal everything we know and that’s why I’m not pointing fingers,” he told reporters at the Parliament building here yesterday.

“I’m a man of courage, I will not run, I will wait. I speak the truth, I will keep voicing out for the sake of (EPF) contributors,” he said.

Earlier at the Dewan Rakyat, Kam­par MP Chong Zhe­min alleged that Dr Wee had misled the House by claiming that EPF had made losses in the MAHB share transaction.

Chong cited Standing Order 36(1), which could lead to an MP being referred to the Parliamentary Rights and Privileges Committee.

However, Deputy Speaker Datuk Dr Ramli Nor said he had taken note of Chong’s claim and asked him to sit down.

“You can file a motion if you’re not satisfied,” Ramli told Chong.

Pemuda Harapan deputy chief Ammar Atan had reportedly said the retirement fund should consider taking legal action against Dr Wee as the latter’s statements on the issue were not based on facts and had a “hidden agenda”.

The Ayer Hitam MP said he only wanted the truth to prevail and the public’s interest to be protected.

“I’ve been in Parliament for a long time. I’m with the government and I do support the government.

“But I cannot stand it when there is a particular individual or group that deliberately says I’m saying untrue things.

“I asked for an explanation in an orderly manner and with decorum.

“I want to do the right thing and will always defend the interest of the rakyat, especially the contri­butors (of EPF),” he emphasised.

Dr Wee wanted to know why MAHB shares were sold for a low price and bought again at a high price by EPF, and who made the decision to do so.",Others,2025-02-21,348
1562643,Rednote fades as TikTok doubles downloads on return to iPhones,"ByteDance Ltd’s TikTok is back on US mobile stores and the app that seemed poised to take its place has suffered a precipitous drop in interest.

In the five days following TikTok’s relisting on Apple Inc’s iPhone app store and Alphabet Inc’s Google Play, downloads of social app Xiaohongshu plummeted by 91%, according to Sensor Tower data. Also known as Rednote, the social app is commonly referred to as China’s version of Instagram and boomed in popularity when TikTok’s potential US ban approached. Daily active users on Rednote are still about a quarter higher than they were prior to TikTok’s delisting, Sensor Tower said.

TikTok itself more than doubled its usual downloads once it was brought back, while all competitors that had gained from its brief removal saw declines, from YouTube and Snap to Facebook and Instagram. The absence was not without a cost for ByteDance, however, as Appfigures estimates the company missed out on around US$142mil (RM627.30mil) in US consumer spending in the app during the time it was gone from Apple and Google’s storefronts.

The fate of TikTok in the US remains in the balance, as President Donald Trump has granted only a 75-day extension – until early April – to the deadline for ByteDance to find a buyer for its US operations or face a ban. To date, the company has rejected the idea of selling, while bidders have emerged, from Perplexity AI to former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt. Trump has indicated he’s keen to strike a deal that serves US interests.

Gross consumer spending on TikTok in the US now averages approximately US$4.7mil (RM20.76mil) per day, slightly lower than the rate before its removal, Appfigures said. The app’s influence extends far beyond its 170 million users in the country, as rivals from YouTube to Instagram have reconfigured their interfaces and pushed short-video content to better compete with TikTok’s popularity. – Bloomberg",Tech,2025-02-21,317

It said Malaysia’s upcoming chairmanship will be key to navigating global uncertainties in the face of the potential intensification of global trade tensions.

""By prioritising economic resilience, innovation, and sustainable practices, Malaysia can lead and consolidate ASEAN’s position as a dynamic economic force and a pivotal player in shaping the future of Asia-Pacific economic integration,” the investment bank said in a note today.

As ASEAN progresses towards its vision of a unified and integrated community by 2030, it said that sustained commitment to these objectives will be crucial for navigating uncertainties and maximising opportunities in an increasingly interconnected world.

""While risks from the trade and geopolitical arenas persist (under the new US administration), Malaysia's neutral stance and diversified trade relationships position the country well to navigate these external challenges,” it said.

Therefore, RHB Investment Bank believes that Malaysia’s growth outlook remains positive, bolstered by its regional integration and economic resilience.

In the medium to longer term, it noted that Malaysia’s strategic location in Southeast Asia, its neutral stance in the geopolitical arena and its developed industrial base and infrastructure make it an attractive destination for businesses looking for alternatives to China.

""In particular, Malaysia’s manufacturing sector especially in electronics, mineral fuels and manufactured articles could see increased demand as companies relocate production out of China,” it said.

Additionally, the investment bank said Malaysia’s role as the world’s sixth-largest exporter of semiconductors positions it to benefit from greater Chinese-related investments and trade, particularly in high-tech sectors such as electronics and semiconductor manufacturing.

""This trend is further supported by a steady increase in foreign direct investment in Malaysia’s tech sector since 2021,” it added. - Bernama",Business,2025-02-21,303
1562164,"Elon Musk ramps up Romanian election dispute, branding chief judge a tyrant","(Reuters) - Elon Musk labelled the chief judge of Romania's top court a ""tyrant"" on Thursday in the latest broadside aimed at Bucharest by a member of U.S. President Donald Trump's administration after the cancellation of a 2024 presidential election.

Romania's Constitutional Court voided the election in December before a second round of voting, after declassified security documents showed suspicions of Russian interference in favour of far-right NATO-critic Calin Georgescu, accusations denied by Moscow.

On Wednesday, Constitutional Court chief judge Marian Enache denounced what he said were threats made by Georgescu, who has warned top court judges that should he be elected, they will be tried for high treason.

In Munich last week, U.S. Vice President JD Vance questioned the cancellation of Romania's election, using it as an example of what he said was undemocratic censorship of free speech and political opponents by European governments.

Musk, who is spearheading the Trump administration's new Department of Government Efficiency, on Thursday shared a post on his X social media platform which said that Enache had rejected U.S. pressure over whether Georgescu should be allowed to run in the repeat election in May.

""This guy is a tyrant, not a judge,"" Musk wrote.

The top court was not immediately available to comment.

Musk has previously reposted Georgescu comments as well as podcasts by controversial right-wing hosts such as Alex Jones that featured him.

Georgescu, who has praised Romania's 1930s fascist leaders and expressed admiration for both the U.S. and Russian presidents, remains voters' top choice in opinion polls.

Musk has faced accusations of meddling in European politics after he criticised leaders including Britain's Keir Starmer while openly supporting Germany's far-right AfD in a German parliamentary election scheduled for Sunday.

On Wednesday, Sihem Ben Sedrine, a veteran politician‮ ‬and head of the Truth and Dignity Commission, was also released after months of detention. Riadh Mouakhar, a former minister, was also freed on Thursday.

The move comes two days after the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights urged Tunisia to end the arrests, arbitrary detentions and jailing of humans rights defenders, lawyers, journalists and politicians

Dozens of senior politicians, including Abir Moussi, leader of the Free Constituonal Party, and Rached Ghannouchi, the head on Ennahda's party, two of Saied’s most prominent opponents, remain in prison since 2023.

Boughalleb, was jailed last year, on charge of insulting a public official, which the journalists union said was aimed at silencing the voices of journalists.

Saied seized extra powers in 2021 when he shut down the elected parliament and moved to rule by decree before assuming authority over the judiciary.

Since Tunisia’s 2011 revolution, press freedom has been a key gain for Tunisians and its media has become one of the most open of any Arab state.

However, politicians, journalists and unions say that freedom of the press now faces a serious threat under Saied's rule. The president, who came to power in 2019 in elections, who has rejected such accusations, saying he will not become a dictator.

""How are you going to end the war unless you're talking to Russia?"" Vance said during remarks at the Conservative Political Action Conference.

A U.S. delegation led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio met in Riyadh with a Russian delegation on Tuesday to discuss how to end the Ukraine war. Ukraine was not included, prompting complaints from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

In the days since, Trump and Zelenskiy have traded insults. Trump called his Ukrainian counterpart a dictator and falsely suggested Ukraine started the war. Zelenskiy said Trump was repeating Russian disinformation.

Vance steered clear of the specifics of the controversy as he spoke at the large gathering of conservatives meeting on the outskirts of Washington. He called Trump ""an effective negotiator"" who ""doesn't take anything off the table.""

As a result of Trump's stepped-up efforts on the Ukraine war, ""I really believe we're on the cusp of peace in Europe for the first time in three years,"" said Vance.

Vance made a high-profile appearance at the Munich Security Conference last week, where he castigated European leaders for not taking stronger action to control migrants entering their countries and accused them of silencing critics of migration policies.

He drew criticism in Europe for the remarks. On Thursday, he got a standing ovation among conservatives when moderator Mercedes Schlapp mentioned his Munich speech on the CPAC stage.

Vance said Trump, who has demanded NATO allies pay more for the common defense, wants strong alliances with Europe ""but I really do think the strength of those alliances is going to depend on whether we take our societies in the right direction.""

Vance dismissed criticism from Democrats that the Trump White House has failed to concentrate more on bringing down inflation, saying Trump has only been in office a month and that it will take time.

The court also upheld the pre-trial detention of an employee of the same hotel and a waiter at a local restaurant, who have been detained since the beginning of last month.

Both are accused of plying Payne, who shot to fame as part of the boyband One Direction, with cocaine during his stay in Buenos Aires, and face up to 15 years in prison if convicted.

Payne fell to his death from a hotel balcony in October.

1562356,Vodafone working on drones to restore mobile signal if masts go down,"LONDON: Drones equipped with special light beams could be used to reconnect mobile phone masts when the underground cable linking them is cut or damaged.

Mobile operator Vodafone has carried out a trial in Spain of concept technology from Google parent firm Alphabet's X labs which uses light beams to carry connectivity, using it to create a temporary connection between two points over three kilometres apart.

The firm said it demonstrated how a temporary mobile connection could be recreated in the event that the underground cables linking phone masts are cut or damaged – whether it be accidentally through building work or as a result of a natural disaster, or through vandalism.

In its test in Seville, two industry-grade drones were equipped with light beam terminals from a Google X project known as Taara, with one drone tethered to a phone mast and the other to a Vodafone data transport hub.

The operator said it was able to establish a two-way connection for a short period, and could offer a solution in the future to help with connectivity issues during emergencies or disaster recovery, as well as aiding with future infrastructure challenges.

Vodafone said it was currently dealing with between 75 and 100 cable breaks each year.

The mobile operator will be showcasing the technology during the Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelona at the beginning of next month.

The firm is also set to show off what it calls a weather sensing network that uses data gathered by the operator as it adjusts its mobile signal across Europe to compensate for heavy rainfall – which can weaken signal strength.

It said it was now working with the European Space Agency and the UK government to gather accurate rainfall measurements and turn all the data into a weather map for areas that are out of reach of existing weather observation posts. – dpa",Tech,2025-02-21,314
1562276,"Trump administration cuts duration of deportation protections for 521,000 Haitians","WASHINGTON -U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Thursday cut the duration of deportation protections and work permits for 521,000 Haitians covered by the Temporary Protected Status program so that they will expire in August, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said.

The decision reverses a Biden administration move last year to extend the protections through February 2026, the spokesperson said, saying the extension was unjustified.

President Donald Trump, a Republican, tried to end most enrollment in the TPS program during his 2017-2021 presidency but was blocked by federal courts. Noem earlier this month revoked a Biden-era TPS extension for some 600,000 Venezuelans and terminated the status for half of them, whose protections and access to work permits expire in April.

Trump falsely said during a September 2024 debate with Democrat Kamala Harris that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating pets, sparking fear of retaliation among Haitians in the city. Trump said a month later that if elected he would revoke TPS for Haitians and deport them.

Noem will now need to decide whether to terminate the status for Haitians.

“President Trump and I are returning TPS to its original status: temporary,"" she said in a statement.

More than a million people, over half of them children, are now displaced within Haiti where gang violence continues unabated despite the start of a United Nations-backed security mission last year, U.N. data published in January showed.

Haiti has lacked elected representatives since 2023 and has not held elections since 2016. The country's capital is almost entirely controlled by armed gangs, and leaders have said security must first be established to hold a free and fair vote.

At the same time, revenue for the year under review eased by 1.1 per cent to RM8.97 billion from RM9.07 billion previously, mainly attributed to lower energy payment recorded from Tanjung Bin Power Sdn Bhd (TBP) due to the decline in applicable coal price (ACP).

1561417,Cricket-Australia in a good Head-space despite shaky Champions Trophy buildup,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia have enough experience and versatility in their lineup to get into tournament-mode quickly for the Champions Trophy following a difficult buildup to the one-day international showpiece, according to opener Travis Head.

The injury-depleted 50-overs world champions go into their opener against England in Lahore on Saturday on the back of two stinging defeats away to Sri Lanka and no warmup matches in Pakistani conditions.

Australia's bowling will rest largely on the shoulders of fringe pacemen and there is pressure on the inexperienced top order batting duo of Matthew Short and Jake Fraser-McGurk after each had twin failures in Sri Lanka.

Some players have not played much 50-over cricket recently, including Head, who played his first one-day international in over four months against Sri Lanka last week.

For all that, Head has backed the Steve Smith-captained squad to click when it counts on the field.

""There's a few guys ... who haven't played a lot of white=ball cricket but those guys are pretty versatile,"" he said.

""I feel like we'll be in a good position, we're experienced enough in that batting unit that the guys who have been playing red ball cricket can transition pretty well.

""We're looking forward to that. We know the first game's the most important in this format and this tournament and that's where all our concentration is at the moment.""

Australia won back-to-back Champions Trophy titles in 2006-09 but were bundled out of the group stage in the last two tournaments in 2013 and 2017.

Sabalenka, who won the Qatar Open in 2020, suffered a second-round defeat to Ekaterina Alexandrova in Doha last week.

Three times Grand Slam champion Sabalenka started her season with a title in Brisbane but has struggled for form after failing to win a third consecutive Australian Open last month.

""I'd say that for the last couple of years, I'm not doing well in the Middle East. I believe we need to change something in the preparation ... because every time I don't feel well playing here,"" the 26-year-old Belarusian said after Wednesday's match.

""Even health-wise I'm struggling. Australia always taking a lot of energy out of me ... ""

""I believe that I'm not that hungry on court. I'm kind of like all over the place in my thoughts and not consistent. The decisions I'm making on the court are a bit wrong and emotionally I'm not on my best.""

The 22-year-old Dane broke Sabalenka's serve six times to secure her first WTA 1000 quarter-final spot. Her victory also served as payback for her third-round loss to Sabalenka at Melbourne Park.

""Last time, I had my chances, but I didn't take them,"" Tauson said. ""Today I was really free in my mind. I knew she had to beat me and I'm the underdog all the way, and I was really enjoying my time out on the court.""

Elena Rybakina, seeded sixth, beat Paula Badosa 4-6 7-6(8) 7-6(2) to make the quarter-finals.

1562118,Tenaga storm into TNB Cup final after fiery clash with Maybank,"KUALA LUMPUR: Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) powered into the TNB Cup final after overcoming a spirited challenge from Maybank in a fiery semi-final at the National Hockey Stadium 2 in Bukit Jalil.

Tenaga made an explosive start, with South Korean international Jang Jong-hyun opening the scoring in the second minute.

Maybank, however, were quick to respond as Ashraf Hamsani struck 11 minutes later to level the score.

The match intensified in the second quarter, with Nik Aiman Rozemi firing Tenaga back into the lead in the 17th minute. But Maybank refused to back down and Shafiq Hassan equalised once again in the 26th minute with a clinical penalty corner strike.

Sensing the need to regain control, Tenaga upped the tempo in the third quarter, piling on the pressure and netting twice, first through Nik Aiman and then Norsyafiq Sumantri, to take a 4-2 lead.

However, they were dealt a setback in the final quarter when Jong-hyun's foul on Amirullah Zainol led to a penalty stroke for Maybank. Kieran Govers made no mistake from the spot, reducing the deficit to 4-3.

The tension escalated further when a heated clash between Shello Silverius and Jack Hayes resulted in a video referral, which saw Hayes handed a red card for allegedly elbowing Silverius. This left Maybank with just 10 men for the remainder of the game.

Tenaga capitalised on the numerical advantage, and in the 51st minute, Azrai coolly slotted home after being set up by Ramadan Rosli.

Maybank, undeterred, hit back again through Muhammad Aslam Hanafiah in the 54th minute to keep the contest alive.

But their bold move to play without a goalkeeper in the dying moments backfired, as Tenaga earned a penalty corner. Jong-hyun stepped up to fire home their sixth goal before Azrai completed his hat-trick a minute before the final whistle.

With a commanding 7-4 victory, Tenaga booked their spot in the final as they set their sights on defending their title.

1561996,"Rwanda says DRC criticism of Arsenal, Bayern and PSG deals threatens regional peace","LONDON (Reuters) - Rwanda on Thursday described recent criticism of its Arsenal, Bayern Munich and Paris St Germain sponsorship deals by the Democratic Republic of Congo’s foreign minister as a threat to regional peace and stability.

Earlier this month DRC's foreign minister Therese Kayikwamba Wagner urged the three clubs to end their ""blood-stained"" sponsorship agreements with ""Visit Rwanda"", questioning the morality of such partnerships while fighting raged in eastern Congo.

Rwanda-backed M23 rebels have seized key parts of eastern Congo in recent weeks in what is the gravest escalation in more than a decade of a long-running conflict rooted in the spillover into Congo of Rwanda's 1994 genocide and the struggle for control of Congo's vast mineral resources.

""The Government of Rwanda rejects recent attempts by the Democratic Republic of Congo to undermine Rwanda’s international partnerships through misinformation and political pressure,"" Rwanda Development Board, which oversees the deals, said in a statement on Thursday.

""These efforts not only misrepresent the truth but also threaten the foundations of regional peace, stability, and economic cooperation that we have worked tirelessly to build.""

Congo's foreign affairs minister did not immediately respond to a request for comment on WhatsApp.

The fighting in eastern Congo has led to human rights violations including summary executions, the bombing of displacement camps, reports of gang rape and other sexual violence, according to the United Nations.

Rwanda says it is defending itself, accusing Congo's military of joining forces with ethnic Hutu-led militias bent on slaughtering Tutsis in Congo and threatening Rwanda, where Hutus targeted Tutsis in a 1994 genocide and some of them later fled to Congo.

""Visit Rwanda"" began their sponsorship of Arsenal in 2018, with the latest deal reported to be worth more than 10 million pounds ($12 million) per year.

Bayern Munich signed a five-year football development and tourism promotion partnership with Rwanda in 2023, while ""Visit Rwanda"" has been a sponsor of PSG since 2019.

Reuters previously contacted the three clubs about the sponsorship deals but none replied.

1562115,Soccer-Spanish FA clears referee Munuera following conflict of interest investigation,"MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish referee Jose Munuera Montero has been cleared of any wrongdoing after the country's football federation (RFEF) looked into a possible conflict of interest between his refereeing and a private sports consultancy company that he co-owns.

The RFEF released a statement on Thursday that said no further action would be taken against the 41-year-old official, who has been under fire since showing Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham a red card for directing foul language at him during Saturday's 1-1 draw at Osasuna.

Munuera closed his Instagram account after receiving tens of thousands of comments, including insults and death threats following the game, with controversy mounting after newspapers Marca and AS reported that his company, Talentus Sports Speakers, had business connections with football institutions and professional clubs.

This led to RFEF opening an investigation to analyse whether those activities were compatible with his refereeing.

""Following the study, analysis and detailed verification of the commercial, corporate and accounting information, the economic activity of these companies and the degree of Munuera Montero's participation in them, the RFEF's Regulatory Compliance Department has concluded that there is no real or potential conflict in the business activities of the referee with his work as a First Division referee,"" RFEF said.

""Consequently, and in accordance with the internal regulations on conflicts of interest and the RFEF's good practices, there is no reason whatsoever to justify the adoption of disciplinary measures against Mr. Munuera Montero.""

Munuera denied any wrongdoing on Tuesday and said his company had not invoiced any sports entity since its creation and threatened legal action against media.

""In recent months, the disproportionate attack on the refereeing collective has become evident, and on this latest occasion I have been the target,"" he said.

The RFEF said on Monday referees were sickened by the abuse Montero has received since showing Bellingham a red card, with the situation reflecting the hate and verbal violence match officials endure.

Bellingham was handed a two-match suspension despite saying in his defence that the referee had misunderstood him as he was talking to himself in English.

""I don't mean to be impolite,"" Mitchell said, looking at von der Leyen. ""But I will say it to you: the issue of reparations... is an issue we will take up with you.""

Mitchell added: ""We owe it to ourselves and future generations of humanity to ensure (slavery) is accepted as a crime against humanity, and that appropriate apology and compensation is paid, and that the international community accepts this should never happen again.""

Von der Leyen replied to Mitchell without referring to reparations, saying ""slavery is a crime against humanity... and the dignity and universal rights of every single human being is untouchable and must be defended by all means"".

From the 15th to the 19th century, at least 12.5 million Africans were kidnapped, forcibly transported by mostly European merchants and sold into slavery.

Calls for reparations for slavery and colonialism are long-standing but have been gaining momentum worldwide, particularly among CARICOM and the African Union (AU).

CARICOM has its own reparation plan, which, among other demands, calls for technology transfers and investments to tackle health crises and illiteracy. The AU is developing its own plan.

In 2023, the EU and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) agreed to include in their summit's final statement a paragraph that acknowledged the ""untold suffering"" slavery inflicted on millions.

In the statement, adopted by leaders of both sides, the CELAC referred to CARICOM's reparations plan.

1561966,Austria moves towards centrist coalition deal after far right fails,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria's two biggest centrist parties are moving quickly towards a coalition deal without the far-right Freedom Party (FPO) after it failed to form a government, party officials said on Thursday.

It would be third time lucky if the conservative People's Party (OVP) and Social Democrats (SPO) managed to strike a deal with some degree of support from smaller centrist parties, since a first effort led by the OVP failed in January, then an attempt led by the eurosceptic, Russia-friendly FPO collapsed last week.

This is the longest it has taken Austria to form a government since World War Two. If no solution is found soon a snap election is likely, with opinion polls suggesting the FPO would increase its share of the vote from 29%, with which it secured first place in September's parliamentary election.

President Alexander Van der Bellen, who oversees the formation of governments, said after the FPO-led effort collapsed that four options remained: a snap election, which cannot be held sooner than in about three months; a minority government; a fresh stab at forming a coalition that could command a majority; or a temporary government of experts.

The closer the OVP and SPO come to a coalition agreement, the more likely Van der Bellen is to name a centrist coalition as the preferred option. The two parties have been working intensively behind closed doors to strike a deal fast.

Party spokespeople said they could neither confirm nor deny reports by two regional newspapers on Thursday morning that an agreement had been reached on how to bring the budget deficit back within the European Union's limit of 3% of economic output.

The FPO and OVP announced a similar deficit agreement three days into their doomed talks.

Officials from the SPO and OVP, speaking on condition on anonymity, cautioned that it was hard to say when a wider coalition deal might be completed, but said talks were advancing quickly and an agreement might be ready by next week.

1561991,IMF mission starts talks on Ukraine loan programme review,"KYIV (Reuters) - Ukrainian officials began talks on Thursday with an International Monetary Fund team working on the country's latest loan programme review, which could unlock about $917 million in new funds.

As the war with Russia enters a fourth year, Ukraine is heavily dependent on foreign financial aid to cover its social and humanitarian spending needs, with the bulk of Ukrainian state revenue going towards funding the defence effort.

It is the seventh regular review of Ukraine's $15.6-billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme, the IMF said in a statement, and economists have said meeting its reform targets could pose challenges for Ukraine.

It includes goals to pass amendments to the country's criminal code and approve legislation to set up an administrative court. Parliament has not considered the draft bills yet.

Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on the Telegram messaging app that the government expected to receive a total of $2.7 billion from the IMF over the course of this year.

""Cooperation with the fund is an important factor in our financial stability,"" Shmyhal said. ""Despite the full-scale war, we continue to transform (the economy) and implement the necessary reforms.""

Since Russia's invasion in February 2022, the IMF has provided a total of $12.4 billion to Ukraine, Shmyhal added.

Finance ministry data showed that the country had received more than $118 billion in foreign financial aid from its allies since the start of the war.

1562020,Swedish police say their intervention in mass shooting prevented more deaths,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Swedish police said on Thursday that their intervention in a mass shooting earlier this month had prevented even more deaths in the country's worst-ever killing spree.

The shooter, identified by Reuters and other media as Rickard Andersson, shot dead 10 people during a 15-minute killing spree on February 4 before turning the gun on himself at the Campus Risbergska adult education centre in the city of Orebro. The motive remains unclear.

Police arrived at the scene some six minutes after the alarm was first received and came under fire, but it took them an hour to find the shooter's body, leading to questions from the media and some survivors about their handling of the incident.

Police said the campus was an ""inferno"" when officers arrived and that Andersson had let off three smoke grenades, making navigation difficult.

""After the perpetrator opened fire at our patrol only two more shots were fired,"" Deputy Regional Police Chief Niclas Hallgren told a press conference. ""A shotgun blast that didn't hit anyone and another shot that ended the perpetrator's life.""

Andersson, a 35-year-old unemployed recluse who owned four licensed firearms, killed himself twelve minutes after the first alarm. His body was found in the school next to three guns. He had fired 70 shots and had over 100 unused cartridges left, police said.

Police reiterated that they believe Andersson selected the victims at random and said they were sifting through vast amounts of material but had yet to find a clear motive for the attack.

""We are working broadly and we don't rule out anything,"" Deputy Police Operation Commander Emelie Bodegrim said. ""But we might have to be ready for that we might not get the answers we wish.""

1562058,White House adviser urges Ukraine to tone down criticism,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House continued to press Kyiv on Thursday with its efforts to bring an end to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, urging it to rein in criticism and quickly sign a minerals deal pushed by U.S. President Donald Trump.

""They need to tone it down and take a hard look and sign that deal,"" Mike Waltz, the White House national security adviser, said in an interview with Fox News.

Pushback from Ukraine on the minerals deal and how Trump is carrying out peace talks is simply unacceptable, Waltz said, given everything the United States has done for Ukraine.

Waltz's comments come a day after Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy traded insults, with Trump calling Zelenskiy a dictator and Zelenskiy saying the U.S. president was living in a disinformation bubble and spewing talking points from Moscow.

However, Waltz said U.S. differences with Ukraine were not irreconcilable, saying: ""The president also said how much he loves the Ukrainian people.""

Ukraine and European leaders have balked at being left out of peace talks begun after Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by telephone last week.

Waltz denied that U.S. allies and Ukraine were not being consulted.

""There's a term for this in diplomacy. It's called shuttle diplomacy, because bringing everybody to the table at once just hasn't worked in the past,"" he said.

""So we've engaged one side, we've engaged the other side, and then we're going to have a process moving forward under President Trump's direction and leadership.""

Kellogg's visit to Kyiv comes at a difficult time in diplomatic terms for Ukraine after U.S. President Donald Trump effectively ended Russian leader Vladimir Putin's political isolation, engaged in bilateral talks with Moscow, and has since echoed Russian lines regarding Ukraine.

""I affirmed Ukraine's willingness to achieve peace through strength and our vision for the necessary steps,"" Sybiha said on X.

He reiterated to Kellogg, who arrived in the Ukrainian capital on Wednesday and said he would ""sit and listen"" as part of his mission, that the security of Ukraine and the transatlantic ""is indivisible"".

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy plans a meeting with Kellogg on Thursday. The envoy already met Ukraine's army top commander, heads of intelligence and special services.

In the past two days, Trump said Ukraine ""should never have started"" the war, launched by Russia in 2022, called Zelenskiy a ""dictator without elections"" and spread false data about his political ratings.

1561932,Students lead 'Dark Indonesia' protests against budget cuts,"YOGYAKARTA, Indonesia (Reuters) - Thousands of students staged 'Dark Indonesia' protests in cities across the country on Thursday against budget cuts and other policies of President Prabowo Subianto, fearing they will undermine social support systems and their futures.

Clad in black, about a thousand placard-carrying students in the major city of Yogyakarta marched through a busy thoroughfare yelling out demands for change, four months after Prabowo took office following a landslide election win.

There were protests in other cities, including the capital Jakarta, and Medan on Sumatra island.

'Dark Indonesia' has gained traction on social media to represent concerns about the cuts. Another popular trend, 'Just Escape First', sees people sharing advice on how to escape to work and live overseas.

Herianto, a student leader in Jakarta, said students are protesting cuts in the education sector after Prabowo ordered a cost-cutting drive to free up around $19 billion that can be used to fund his policies, including a school lunch plan.

""Indonesia is dark because there are many policies that aren't clear to our society,"" Herianto, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, said.

""The cuts are designed to plug a hole in the free meal programme expenses. Education is one of the things that could be impacted. Students are so angry.""

Prabowo's office has said the funding changes would not affect the education sector and teacher welfare, but with ministries cutting back a wide range of spending there are concerns that it could disrupt government services.

The students were also demonstrating against the military's move into civilian roles and a lack of subsidised cooking gas.

Prabowo remains broadly popular across the sprawling country, with his approval rating near 80% in surveys conducted by independent pollsters, including one last month by research firm Indikator Politik Indonesia.

The demonstrations were the biggest since last August, before Prabowo took office, when the parliament shelved plans to revise election laws after thousands of protesters took to the streets, setting fires and facing down tear gas and water cannon.

Trump has repeatedly criticised Taiwan for taking U.S. semiconductor business, saying he wants the industry to re-base to the United States.

He has also threatened broad import tariffs on countries which have unbalanced trade with the United States, which could affect Taiwan, given the large trade surplus it runs.

Speaking at the Halifax International Security Forum in Taipei, Joseph Wu, head of Taiwan's National Security Council, said the island had many friends in the new administration, especially in the security and defence apparatus.

""The Trump administration support for Taiwan remains very strong,"" he said. ""I think Taiwan is in a good position.""

Asked about Trump's comments on chips, Wu said that Taiwan's TSMC, the dominant maker of advanced semiconductors, started from scratch.

""We didn't steal anything from anybody. Taiwan has been very honest in doing business with the international community,"" he said.

Taiwan runs a large trade surplus with the United States, which surged 83% last year, with the island's exports to the U.S. hitting a record $111.4 billion, driven by demand for high-tech products such as semiconductors.

Taiwan is discussing what else it can buy from the United States, Wu said.

""If the United States has a very good product Taiwan happens to need, then it will be (among) the items that we will be thinking about,"" he added.

Liquefied natural gas, of LNG, is one area the government is already considering, especially from Alaska, though most of Taiwan's supplies at present come from Qatar and Australia.

Wu said U.S. LNG was very high quality, but coming from existing suppliers Texas and Louisiana, it took longer to reach Taiwan given it had to go via the Panama Canal.

""If Alaska starts producing LNG in big numbers, that will be a very good time for us to buy more and we are in discussion with Alaska now,"" he said, without giving details.

Last year's champions will face either Bayer Leverkusen or city rivals Atletico Madrid, depending on Friday's draw, as they seek a record-extending 16th title.

Mbappe opened the scoring with Real's first attack in the fourth minute, taking advantage of another massive blunder by City's defence when captain Ruben Dias missed his header and left the French forward free to lob over the onrushing Ederson.

Mbappe scored again in the 33rd minute with a close-range strike after a humiliating cutback that left defender Josko Gvardiol on the floor.

Real kept piling on the pressure and wasting chances against Pep Guardiola's struggling team. Mbappe scored his third in the 61st minute with a left-footed strike from the edge of the box just inside Ederson's right post.

Manchester City scored a compensation goal at the death, Nico Gonzalez converting a rebound after Omar Marmoush's free kick bounced off the crossbar, but it did little to tarnish a fantastic night for the Spaniards.

U.S. President Donald Trump upended U.S. policy on theUkraine war this week, denouncing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as a ""dictator"" and suggesting Kyiv started the three year war between Ukraine and Russia.

Trump warned that Zelenskiy had to move quickly to secure peace or risk losing his country, deepening a feudbetween the two leaders that has alarmed European officials.

The U.S. and Russia held peace talks in Saudi Arabia this week without Ukraine, stunning Kyiv and its European allies.

Ukraine has said it will not accept a deal imposed on it without its consent, which European leaders have echoed, while Russia has ruled out conceding land it has won.

Addressing a business conference in the city of Thessaloniki late on Wednesday, Mitsotakis said that Europe needed to ""wake up from the geopolitical and economic lethargy into which it has unfortunately fallen for some time"".

""Recent developments and this different view of things from the United States now oblige us not only to face the truth, but to move at a very high speed and implement decisions that we have been discussing for long,"" he said.

Mitsotakis pointed to Europe setting up a defence policy which will allow it to develop its own deterrent power and reduce reliance on the United States.

His comments were made shortly after he joined virtually a second meeting that France convened with European leaders and Canada to discuss Ukraine.

Europe has relied heavily on U.S. might within NATO for security and Trump has consistently demanded Europe spend more on defence. Trump has now demanded that Europe provide more military muscle for any future Ukraine peace deal, but experts say Europe would be stretched to do so without U.S. assistance.

1561664,Russia says has taken back major chunk of Kursk region from Ukrainian forces,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian forces have taken back more than 800 square km (309 square miles) of territory from Ukraine in the Kursk region of western Russia, or about 64% of the total taken by Ukraine since an incursion began last year, a top Russian general said.

Colonel General Sergei Rudskoi, head of the General Staff's main operational directorate, told the Krasnaya Zvezda newspaper that Russia was advancing in all directions and Ukraine had been pushed into a defensive stance since February 2024 amid a major Russian offensive that took back considerable territory.

Rudskoi said Russia now controlled 75% of Ukraine's Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions and more than 99% of the Luhansk region. He said the four regions are now legally part of Russia and will never be returned to Ukraine.

""Last year was a turning point in achieving our goals. The Kyiv regime will no longer be able to significantly change the situation on the battlefield,"" Rudskoi said. ""The enemy has largely lost the ability to produce the necessary weapons, equipment and ammunition. Mobilisation is usually forced.""

Rudskoi said the future of the conflict no longer depended on Ukraine but on whether or not the West would agree to craft a new European security architecture which took into account Russia's interests.

U.S. President Donald Trump has upended U.S. policy on the Ukraine war, denouncing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as a ""dictator"" on Wednesday and warning he had to move quickly to secure peace or risk losing his country, deepening a feud between the two leaders that has alarmed European officials.

Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 as part of what President Vladimir Putin calls a ""special military operation"", triggering the deadliest war in Europe since World War Two and pitting Russian forces against Ukraine's Western-backed army.

Russia also controls Crimea which it annexed in 2014.

Russia currently controls just under a fifth of Ukraine.

The immigration order bars the use of federal money for migrants in the country illegally, directing all agencies to identify any federally funded programs that do so.

The executive action also ensures that federal funds cannot be used by state or local ""sanctuary"" jurisdictions, according to the White House. Sanctuary cities prevent local law enforcement from assisting federal civil immigration officers.

In another order, Trump instructed the heads of every agency to undertake a review of all regulations, working with members of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. Any regulations that are deemed inconsistent with the administration's policies will be rescinded or modified, the order said.

The action aims to bolster Musk's sweeping government-slashing effort, which is facing numerous court challenges over its lawfulness.

Trump also targeted a number of advisory committees and agencies for elimination, part of his broader campaign to assert control over independent executive agencies.

Among the agencies set to be disbanded are the United States Institute for Peace, which promotes conflict resolution around the world; the Inter-American Foundation, which funds community development programs in Latin America and the Caribbean; and the U.S. African Development Foundation, which invests in community development efforts in Africa.

The statement did not include any references to Russia's war in Ukraine nor President Donald Trump's desire to end it quickly by kicking off talks with Moscow, a move that has alarmed European leaders.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's nationalist government has long been at loggerheads with Hungary's Western allies on a range of issues, including its relatively good economic ties with Russia, media freedoms and human rights issues.

Former president Joe Biden's administration in December granted Hungary an exemption from sanctions on Russia's Gazprombank, a move that allows Hungary to continue to make payments for Russian gas via the financial institution.

Earlier on Wednesday, sources told Reuters that Bessent would skip a G20 finance ministers and central bank governors meeting in South Africa next week, a gathering where he would be able to meet with multiple counterparts from the world's largest economies.

The 23-year-old completed the course in 47 minutes and 58.1 seconds, 52.4 seconds ahead of Tommaso Giacomel of Italy, who took silver, with Quentin Fillon Maillet securing the bronze for France, just under two minutes behind the winner.

The brilliant run of form that had Norwegian Johannes Thingnes Boe win the first two individual gold medals at the championships came to an abrupt halt after three misses at the first shoot, causing him to finish well outside the top 10.

Warm weather and bright sunshine in Lenzerheide, Switzerland greeted the 97 participants as they set off on the course at 30-second intervals, but with each missed shot adding a minute to their time, the athletes had to be wary of the tricky gusts of wind that caused them problems on the shooting range.

Local favourites Niklas Hartweg and Sebastian Stalder at one point were first and second after crossing the line, but with the stronger contenders all starting in the middle of the field, the two Swiss racers were eventually edged off the podium.

The company forecast its fiscal 2025 revenue to be between $3.33 billion and $3.40 billion, the midpoint of which is below the analysts' average estimate of $3.40 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.

Grab faces competition from smaller rivals such as Foodpanda and Indonesia's GoTo in the food delivery space. That only exacerbates worries at a time when consumer sentiment remains weak amid macroeconomic volatilities.

Earlier this month, Reuters reported, citing sources familiar with the matter, that the company was in advanced talks to merge with GoTo as they seek to boost market share as a combined entity.

""Grab does not comment on media speculation or rumors,"" Chief Financial Officer Peter Oey told Reuters, adding that the company has a very high bar for mergers and acquisitions.

GoTo said that it is not engaged in any discussions about a possible merger transaction.

To get ahead in a highly competitive market, Grab has been attempting to boost its subscriber base and drive higher usage on its app, which provides a wide array of services including food delivery, ride-hailing and its fast-growing financial segment.

""Our subscriber base retention actually has been very healthy, and we have more subscribers on our platform than ever before,"" with paid members spending four times more than non-subscribers, Oey said.

Urso did not give a timing for the development of the project and did not specify which companies the government had called in, but said the national space agency would carry out a feasibility study.

Musk has a warm relationship with Meloni and said last month he would be ready to offer his services to Italy. However, Defence Minister Guido Crosetto denied an agreement had been sealed.

Starlink, part of Musk's SpaceX aerospace business, has 6,700 active satellites in low earth orbit. A source told Reuters that Italy was considering a five-year deal with the company worth 1.5 billion euros ($1.57 billion).

1561679,Nvidia unveils powerful AI system for genetic research,"SAN FRANCISCO: AI chipmaker Nvidia and research partners have created what they call the largest artificial intelligence system yet for biological research, the company said on Feb 19, aiming to speed up breakthroughs in medicine and genetics.

The new AI system, called Evo 2, can read and design genetic code across all forms of life.

Scientists have high hopes that such AI technology will dramatically accelerate research by spotting patterns in vast amounts of data that would normally take years to analyse by hand.

The system learned from nearly 9 trillion pieces of genetic information taken from over 128,000 different organisms, including bacteria, plants, and humans.

In early tests, it accurately identified 90% of potentially harmful mutations in BRCA1, a gene linked to breast cancer.

Scientists say this could help develop more precise treatments, including gene therapies that only target specific cells.

The model was built using 2,000 Nvidia H100 processors on Amazon's cloud infrastructure.

Developed with the Arc Institute and Stanford University, Evo 2 is now freely available to scientists worldwide through Nvidia's BioNeMo research platform.

""Designing new biology has traditionally been a laborious, unpredictable and artisanal process,"" said Brian Hie, assistant professor at Stanford University.

""With Evo 2, we make biological design of complex systems more accessible to researchers.""

Beyond medicine, researchers believe the technology could help create crops that better withstand climate change and develop new ways to break down pollution.

The project brings together Nvidia's computing power with the Arc Institute, a nonprofit research center founded in 2021 with US$650mil (RM2.87bil) in funding.

The institute works closely with Stanford, UC Berkeley, and UC San Francisco to tackle long-term scientific challenges. – AFP",Tech,2025-02-20,276
1561603,Russia's Yandex reports record annual revenues for 2024,"(Reuters) - Russian internet firm Yandex reported annual revenues above 1 trillion roubles ($11.22 billion) for the first time on Thursday, in a year when the business underwent a significant restructuring.

A Russian consortium of buyers in July finalised a $5.4 billion cash-and-stock deal to acquire Yandex's Russia-based assets, which had been held through Yandex's Nasdaq-listed Dutch parent, the largest corporate exit since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, albeit at a hefty discount.

Revenue grew 37% year on year to 1.1 trillion roubles in 2024, Yandex said. In 2025, the company, whose Moscow-listed shares rose 1.3% on Thursday, said it expects revenue growth of at least 30%.

""We operate in large and fast-growing markets, in many of which we hold leading positions,"" Yandex said. ""This opens significant growth prospects for us for many years to come.""

Russia is Yandex's major market, where it dominates search and advertising. It has offices in several former Soviet countries and operates its ride-hailing service in a handful of African and European countries, but the business split has largely shut off its access to the U.S. market.

Since its foundation in the late 1990s dotcom boom, Yandex has prioritised growth, reinvesting profits in the company's varied tech services, from e-commerce to cloud, but in July, under new ownership, it proposed paying dividends for the first time.

The company's management recommended dividends of 80 roubles per share for the full year 2024, after paying interim dividends last year. Full-year adjusted net profit was up 94% year on year to 100.9 billion roubles.

Yandex said the business' growth in scale would see capital expenditures as a percentage of revenues decrease year-on-year in 2025.

The corporate restructuring saw Yandex's former Dutch parent, now renamed Nebius Group retain capital-intensive, internationally focused businesses in the cloud, autonomous driving and education technology sectors.

Nebius hopes to become a key player in building the infrastructure underpinning artificial intelligence, with Yandex co-founder and former CEO Arkady Volozh at the helm.

1561493,‘Like science fiction’: Alarm as SpaceX rocket lights up German skies,"ESSEN, Germany: Mysterious flashing lights in the sky caused alarm across Germany on Tuesday night, with authorities confirming that a rocket used by US space company SpaceX was the cause.

Germany's Space Component Command, a branch of the German Air Force, said on Wednesday that there was no evidence that debris fell over Germany.

The lights were caused due to the re-entry of parts of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket into the Earth's atmosphere, a spokesman for the command said.

The rocket was launched from the United States on Feb 1.

Numerous residents called German police to report unusual lights in the sky shortly after midnight.

Germany's UFO reporting agency, CENAP, said it recorded some 120 calls early on Wednesday.

A man from Lichtenfels in the western state of Hesse told the hr3 radio station that he was fertilizing his field when he saw the lights.

""Something split up, there were glowing stripes in white, red and orange, and then it slowly disappeared into the horizon. It was somehow phenomenal,"" he said. ""It looked more like a science fiction film – as if aliens were landing.""

SpaceX, founded by billionaire Elon Musk, has carried out several launches from Florida for its Starlink satellite internet provider in recent weeks, including on Tuesday night.

While the first stage of the rocket is reusable, the second stage burns up when it re-enters the atmosphere, sometimes weeks after the launch.

The space command spokesman said the rockets can burn up in the sky across the planet, with the part that caused alarm on Tuesday night having re-entered the atmosphere somewhere over Great Britain or Northern Ireland. – dpa",Tech,2025-02-20,274

Najib's lawyer Wan Azwan Aiman Wan Fakhruddin said that Brian Chia, a former partner at the law firm Wong & Partners, was unreachable.

Wong & Partners was previously a legal adviser to 1MDB.

""Since January, we have attempted to contact him but to no avail.

""We also contacted and spoke to other lawyers in the legal fraternity. They also do not know where he (Chia) is at the moment.

""To the best of our assumption, he is not within the jurisdiction,"" Wan Azwan said at the RM2.28bil 1MDB trial here on Thursday.

Chia was scheduled to take the stand as the 10th defence witness in Thursday’s (Feb 20) proceedings.

Wan Azwan said that Chia was initially a prosecution witness but he was never called to the stand.

After the end of the prosecution's trial, Chia was offered as a witness to the defence.

Presiding judge Justice Collin Lawrence Sequerah then asked the defence what would the next action be if the witness remained unreachable.

Wan Azwan said that the defence would proceed with other witnesses.

""But as far as Chia is concerned, it is incumbent for the prosecution to seek the best endeavour to have him available to us for us to examine him,"" Wan Azwan said.

Deputy Public Prosecutor Kamal Baharin Omar concurred that Chia was an offered witness by the prosecution.

1561734,"Bangladesh to import 100,000 tonnes of white rice from Vietnam","HANOI: Bangladesh will import 100,000 tonnes of white rice from Vietnam under a cooperation agreement between the two governments.

This export contract was signed under the Government-to-Government (G2G) framework and will be supplied by the Vietnam Southern Food Corporation (Vinafood II), according to the Vietnam Food Association.

The selling price has been set at US$474.25 per tonne, higher than the typical international market price for white rice, reflecting the stability in quality and the strong reputation of Vietnamese rice.

The purchase proposal from Bangladesh’s Ministry of Food was approved by the Bangladesh Public Procurement Authority in Dhaka on Jan 28, paving the way for the upcoming import activities.

The large-scale import of white rice from Vietnam is part of Bangladesh’s strategy to stabilise food prices, particularly as the country implements its Open Market Sales (OMS) programme starting in February.

Under this plan, the government will distribute around 907 tonnes of rice daily through 906 centres nationwide, including the capital Dhaka, major cities and labour-intensive regions. The rice will be sold at 30 Tk per kg (approximately $243 per tonne), enabling low-income populations to access essential food supplies at affordable prices.

Bangladesh is one of South Asia’s largest rice producers. However, the country still needs to import rice at certain times to balance supply and demand. In 2023, Bangladesh imported nearly two million tonnes of rice from countries including India, Thailand, Vietnam and Myanmar.

The export of 100,000 tonnes of rice reaffirms the strong position of Vietnamese rice in the global market. It also encourages farmers to grow high-quality rice that meets export standards and enhances the economic value of Vietnamese rice.

In recent years, Vietnam has made significant advancements in improving product quality, diversifying export markets and enhancing supply chains.

New high-yield rice varieties with improved resilience and better quality have helped Vietnam compete with major rice-exporting nations including Thailand and India.

In addition to Bangladesh, Vietnam is a key rice supplier for many other markets, including China, the Philippines, Indonesia and several African countries.

In 2024 alone, rice exports exceeded eight million tonnes, generating nearly $5 billion in revenue, the highest level in over a decade. — Vietnam News/ANN",Politics,2025-02-20,360

Singapore-based KBP Biosciences and its founder led the Danish maker of blockbuster obesity drug Wegovy to believe they had “developed a new and effective drug to treat hypertension and kidney disease”, according to a ruling the court made public this week.

Novo bought the medicine, called ocedurenone, from closely held KBP Biosciences for as much as US$1.3 billion in late 2023.

Less than a year later, it halted a clinical trial because the treatment was not working and announced an impairment loss of about US$800 million.

Singapore’s International Commercial Court agreed to freeze KBP Biosciences’ assets and those of its founder and executive chairman Huang Zhenhua, according to the ruling.

1561608,Impeachment trial vs VP Sara Duterte can start by March: Senate Minority leader,"MANILA: Senate Minority leader Aquilino Pimentel III believes the Senate can start acting on the impeachment proceeding against Vice President Sara Duterte as early as March.

Speaking to reporters in the “Kapihan sa Senado” forum on Thursday, Pimentel said Senate President Francis Escudero himself was “prepared” for the trial, noting that the rules had already been reviewed.

Asked when the impeachment trial should start, Pimentel immediately said in a mix of Filipino and English: “I hope in March… The SP [Senate president] has already prepared. He has asked for a review of the rules. That’s easy.”

“When the court goes in session, we will take the oath. We will affirm the existing rules so that there will be no issue on whether or not these are valid,” he went on.

“If we will propose amendments, then we will open. And then, we will authorise the Senate president to send summons to the impeached officials so that the 10 days will be in operation. It will be a pity if we will lose those days,” he added.

While Pimentel insisted that the trial should start by March, he also said that his use of the word ‘trial’ was a bit broad.

“My use of ‘trial’ is somewhat generic — meaning, the entire process,” he explained.

“Maybe witnesses would still not sit on the witness stand. It’s just that trial will start in a sense that the impeachment officials will be asked to answer. The prosecutors will be asked to respond.”

But does this mean that the Senate should have already convened into an impeachment court by March?

Pimentel said yes — so there would be no questions about the subsequent steps of the case. - Philippine Daily Inquirer/ANN",Politics,2025-02-20,287

1560494,Quantum camera could help detect cancer as soon as it forms,"The imminent development of quantum cameras promises to transform many sectors, starting with medicine. Thanks to images of unprecedented precision, this technology could, for example, help detect the presence of cancer cells in their earliest stages of formation.

A quantum camera is a cutting-edge device capable of detecting individual photons, the smallest units of light. This technology relies on ultra-precise sensors that capture each photon and transform it into a detectable electronic signal. Unlike traditional cameras, a quantum camera is therefore capable of perceiving tiny amounts of light. This makes it possible to create very detailed images, even in very low light conditions.

Researchers at the Institute for Quantum Computing at the University of Waterloo in Canada have announced significant advances in this field. Two doctoral students, Sarah Odinotski and Jack DeGooyer, are working on the design of microcircuits capable of processing the weak signals generated by photon sensors. Their goal is to create the most precise camera possible, offering near-perfect sensitivity.

One of the first practical uses of this type of technology could be in the medical world. This discovery could, for example, be used in the detection of abnormalities in biological tissues – starting with the formation of cancer cells – much earlier than current methods allow. By capturing images with an unprecedented level of detail, these quantum cameras could offer doctors the possibility of diagnosing and treating serious illnesses much more quickly.

One of the most promising applications of this technology is in the field of medical imaging. Thanks to their extreme sensitivity, quantum cameras could, in the future, greatly facilitate the work of doctors and researchers. – AFP Relaxnews",Tech,2025-02-20,273

1561598,Yen climbs to strongest this year versus dollar on BOJ hike bets,"TOKYO: The yen hit its strongest level against the dollar since December, beating all major currencies’ performance on Thursday (Feb 20) amid growing speculation the Bank of Japan (BOJ) will hike rates sooner rather than later.

Japan’s currency climbed as much as 0.8 per cent to 150.21 against the dollar, a level it hasn’t touched since Dec. 9. Government bond yields are also on the rise, with the 10-year benchmark hitting its highest level since 2009. Overnight index swaps are pricing in an 83 per cent chance of a rate hike by the central bank’s July meeting, compared with about 70 per cent odds at the start of this month, with a hike now seen as certain by September.

The central bank’s governor Kazuo Ueda said on Thursday that he did not discuss rising yields in a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. BOJ Board Member Hajime Takata also said on Wednesday that it’s important to continue considering gradual rate hikes, while also noting that Japan’s bond yields are moving in line with the market’s view of the economy.

""It’s significant that Takata didn’t express any concern about rising yields,” said Yujiro Goto, head of FX strategy at Nomura Securities Co., in a note. That leaves room for further rises in JGB yields and the yen, he said.

Japan’s recent data has also supported the BOJ’s case for raising rates, with gross domestic product outperforming forecasts and nominal wages jumping by the fastest pace in nearly three decades. - Bloomberg",Politics,2025-02-20,251

1560492,This robotic hand features real human tissue,"Japanese researchers have developed the first biohybrid hand capable of performing complex gestures using human muscle tissue grown in a laboratory. This could pave the way for unprecedented uses.

Scientists at the University of Tokyo and Waseda University in Japan have succeeded in developing a unique biohybrid hand. The key to this innovation lies in the use of multiple muscle tissue actuators (MuMuTA), hybrid structures combining living tissue and 3D-printed plastic that convert an energy source into mechanical movement or action.

These actuators are capable of contracting and relaxing, mimicking the functions of human muscles to achieve autonomous movement. Organized in a structured way, they can then perform complex gestures, thanks to their ability to contract and coordinate fluidly.

This biohybrid hand is now capable of performing relatively complex gestures, such as the scissor action. In fact, this technology represents a significant advance in the development of future biohybrid limbs, ever more realistic and capable of imitating real human movements.

Future applications of this technology look promising. It could revolutionize the field of biohybrid prostheses, offering amputees the possibility of regaining a much more natural form of mobility than with current prostheses. In the future, this type of innovation could also have a major impact on pharmaceutical testing, in the case of drugs specifically targeting muscle tissue.

Finally, the whole field of robotics could one day benefit from these advances, with the arrival of humanoid robots capable of simulating perfectly and infinitely human movements applied to very specific tasks.

1561606,Besi forecasts unexpected sales drop for first quarter,"(Reuters) -Dutch chipmaking parts supplier BE Semiconductor Industries (Besi) forecast an unexpected sales drop for the first quarter on Thursday, as weakness in its traditional markets offsets positive AI related orders.

Besi's shares fell 10% to the bottom of Europe's benchmark STOXX 600 index at 0805 GMT, and will see their worst daily decline since October if the losses hold through the day.

The chip assembly equipment maker expects its quarterly sales to fall by up to 10% from the 153.4 million euros ($159.9 million) it reported for the final quarter of 2024.

Analysts were expecting revenue to grow to 170.2 million euros in the first quarter, according to LSEG's IBES data.

Degroof Petercam analyst Michael Roeg said the first quarter guidance came well below market expectations, while fourth quarter results were a broad miss, with order bookings significantly below estimates.

Bookings, an important metric to forecast future growth, were 121.9 million euros in the fourth quarter, against analysts' estimate of 171 million euros in a Visible Alpha consensus.

""We enter the year 2025 with cautious optimism based on strong momentum in our advanced die placement solutions for AI applications partially offset by ongoing weakness in mainstream automotive, smart phone, industrial and Chinese end-user markets,"" CEO Richard Blickman said in a statement.

Investors are banking on growing orders for Besi's hybrid bonding solutions and the company's first-mover advantage amid a surge in demand for AI-enabling technology.

But its traditional markets - tools destined for the production of chips used in cars and smartphones - are facing a more than two year long downturn, as manufacturers push back orders to manage their excess manufacturing capacity.

Besi said it expects recovery in the mainstream assembly markets to start only in the second half of 2025, which will also depend on end market trends and the course of global trade restrictions.

Co-founded by several former Intel central processing unit (CPU) engineers and executives, the company plans to build technology and chips based on the open source architecture called RISC-V, pronounced ""risk five.""

AheadComputing plans to use the funds to design and develop CPU technology that aims to solve some of the computing performance issues that have arisen around artificial intelligence, such as bandwidth shortages and data processing limitations.

Co-founder and CEO Debbie Marr said it was an opportune moment for a startup that relieson RISC-V technology because it avoids the pitfalls of the x86 architecture used by Intel and Advanced Micro Devices and the problems associatedwith relying on a single supplier - Arm Holdings - for the underlying designs.

""The RISC-V ecosystem is open, it's not owned, it's not controlled by one company,"" Marr said in an interview with Reuters. ""There are hundreds of players. There is plenty of room for innovation.""

Marr and other senior executives left last year and founded AheadComputing, which is headquartered in Portland. Marr and other AheadComputing executives were responsible for developing several key technologies at Intel that significantlyimproved CPU performance.

The seed funding round was led by Eclipse Ventures and included Maverick Capital, Fundomo and EPIQ Capital Group. Former Apple and Tesla chip architect Jim Keller invested in the round as well. Keller runs his own RISC-V venture called Tenstorrent.

Founding the company was attractive because of the growing demand for high-performance computing, Eclipse partner Greg Reichow said in an interview. By 2030, it will be roughly $100 billion, he said.

1561948,Bodies of five missing miners found in India after 44 days,"NEW DELHI: (Bernama-Xinhua) After 44 days of intense search, rescuers in India's northeastern state of Assam have retrieved the bodies of five missing trapped workers from inside a coal mine, Xinhua reported, citing officials on Wednesday (Feb 19).

The bodies were recovered on Wednesday from the rat-hole coal mine in Umrangso of Dima Hasao district, about 241 kilometres southeast of Dispur, the capital city of Assam.

The workers went missing on Jan 6, following sudden flooding inside the mine.

Although search and rescue operations were launched immediately by multiple agencies, including the Indian army, navy, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and Coal India Limited, only four miners' bodies were recovered in the first six days.

Since then the operation was underway. Despite pressing several high-pressure pumps to dewater the mine, the water level was not receding.

The state education and information committee chairman said the primary and secondary schools, which would be built over five years were announced by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim under Budget 2025.

“The approval of the 18 new schools was a result of the state’s active engagements with the Education Ministry to highlight the issues we face.

“In the state, the issue of student density mostly affects the Johor Baru and Pasir Gudang district education offices.

“The district of Johor Baru is densely populated, which is why it has to have two district education offices,” he said after witnessing the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the Johor Public Library and Universiti Teknologi Mara here Thursday (Feb 20).

Aznan added that the new schools would hopefully help to address the issue by dispersing the high student volume in those areas and providing them with a more comfortable learning environment.

He said most of the new schools would be located in Johor Baru and Pasir Gudang, as well as Batu Pahat, Kluang and Tangkak.

Some of the new schools are SK Bandar Seri Alam 3, SK Taman Scientex 2, SK Taman Nusa Damai 2, SK Taman Desa Tebrau, SK Taman Setia Tropika, SK Bandar Uda Utama, SK Taman Nusa Bayu and SK Kota Masai 4.

The visit coincided with the Melaka government’s free-entry initiative, which granted complimentary access to 13 tourism spots in conjunction with the state holiday marking the Declaration of Independence of the Federation of Malaya on Thursday (Feb 20).

Speaking to reporters at the Taman Rempah Jetty here, Ab Rauf shared his observations on the seamless execution of the free-entry programme compared to the previous year when the initiative was first introduced.

“I observed the smoothness when visiting several tourist locations.

""This was achieved through improvements made to each tourism product in the second edition of the free-entry incentive,” he said.

""This is the perfect opportunity for Melakans to fully enjoy these tourist attractions for free and take advantage of this gift from the Melaka government to relax and spend quality time with their loved ones,” he added.

He said the state government aims to attract up to 70,000 visitors to enjoy these attractions by the end of the day.

1562071,Quantum computing stocks rise as Microsoft's new chip heats up debate over technology,"Quantum computing stocks advanced on Thursday after Microsoft launched a new chip that indicated the technology is not ""decades away"" as stated by the top boss of AI chip bellwether Nvidia.

Microsoft unveiled its Majorana 1 chip on Wednesday and said it is less prone to errors than rivals, while providing evidence in a scientific paper set to be published in academic journal Nature.

Quantum computing holds the promise of carrying out calculations that would take today's systems millions of years. If successful the technology could also potentially disrupt today's cybersecurity systems.

Shares ofIonQ gained 2.1%, Rigetti Computing rose 6.9% and D-Wave Quantum advanced 11.1%, while those of smaller peers Quantum Corp added 2.6% and Quantum Computing climbed 4.5%.

Shares of Microsoft edged up 0.5%, while Nvidia inched up 0.3%.

When quantum computers will arrive has become a topic of debate in the upper echelons of the tech industry. Microsoft along with Alphabet and IBM are in a growing camp of companies that believe the technology's practical use is nearer than previously imagined.

Quantum computing stocks took a hit in early January when Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the technology was two decades away from overtaking his company's chips, which are the workhorses of artificial intelligence.

The stocks logged monthly losses in January, ending a year-long rally that saw them outperform the tech-focused Nasdaq, as well as Nvidia and Microsoft.

They have lost between 18% and 70% so far this year, compared with last year when they had risen at least three-fold.

Two sources said that Adam Presser, operations head of the app who also oversees the unit, sent a memo out to staff on Thursday notifying them of the move.

The layoffs began the same day for teams in Asia and Europe, Middle East and Africa, two of the sources said.

TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The move comes as TikTok's fate remains up in the air. The popular short video app used by nearly half of all Americans went dark briefly last month, before a law took effect on January 19 that required its Chinese owner ByteDance either to sell it on national security grounds or face a ban.

In January last year, TikTok Shou Chew testified before Congress alongside Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg and other tech and media heads in a hearing where lawmakers accused the companies of failing to protect children from escalating threats of sexual predation on their platforms.

Replying to questions from Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, TikTok's CEO had said that the company would spend more than $2 billion on trust and safety efforts.

In October last year, the company laid off hundreds of employees from its global workforce, including a large number of staff in Malaysia as it shifts focus towards a greater use of AI in content moderation.

TikTok says it has 40,000 trust and safety professionals worldwide. Reuters was not able to immediately establish the extent of these cuts.

Zuckerberg met with senators one day after his personal charity announced it was ending diversity, equity and inclusion programmes. He shut down some of Meta’s diversity efforts days before Trump took office last month. Eliminating DEI initiatives has been a priority for the Trump administration and many Republican lawmakers.

Meta has made AI a pillar of the company’s focus and investment. It is building several AI-powered products, including smartglasses and other headsets, and has earmarked as much as US$65bil (RM287.96bil) in spending this year that will largely go toward AI-related investments. Having a voice in any potential AI regulation is important to Zuckerberg as the company competes globally on AI technology.

Meta spokesperson Andy Stone would only describe the CEO’s conversations in general terms and declined to identify which senators Zuckerberg met.

""He is on the Hill talking with members about issues including AI and American tech leadership,” Stone said.

Zuckerberg and Meta’s lobbyists have been urging lawmakers to push back against European Union regulations on large multinational tech companies. That includes the Digital Services Act, which punishes social media companies for hosting harmful speech and misinformation.

Zuckerberg has derided the law as censorship, echoing a conservative talking point. In a video, he pledged to work with Trump to “push back on governments going after American companies and pushing to censor more”.

Meta’s global policy chief, Joel Kaplan, last weekend told the Munich Security Conference that Meta is asking for the White House’s support as the company faces a regulatory crackdown in Europe.

""When companies are treated differently in a way that is discriminatory against them, then that should be highlighted to that company’s home government. So I think we will do that with President Trump,” Joel Kaplan said during the conference on Feb 16. – Bloomberg",Tech,2025-02-20,342

Selangor police chief Datuk Hussein Omar Khan said it was part of their recommendations to the state government and the Housing and Local Government Ministry early this month as efforts to curb drug taking at entertainment events.

It would also tighten conditions to concert organisers who previously would only place such reminders on concert tickets, he added.

He said usually, there would be about three incidents a year, adding that the recent surge had become a cause for concern.

“One of my fishing boats was approached by pirates on Feb 14. Armed with a gun and three machetes, they boarded the vessel and forced my workers into the storage area and they destroyed our fishing nets worth about RM40,000,” he told a press conference organised by Pantai Remis assemblyman Wong May Ing here yesterday.

See, 32, said the pirates also stole equipment on the ship, including the GPS and his workers’ mobile phones.

“One of my workers injured his arm but thankfully, no lives were lost,” he added.

Another operator, who only wanted to be known as Issac, said the attacks also affected the hiring of foreign hands.

“Some fishermen are planning to quit, as it is hard to carry on without foreign workers,” he said, calling for a special team to be set up to resolve the issue.

Mohamad Faqih Mustapha claim­ed trial to all the charges read out to him before judge Elesabet Paya Wan at the Sessions Court in Ayer Keroh here yesterday.

The amount was allegedly an inducement to secure case referrals related to housing loan tran­sactions with MBSB Bank by an executive officer under his supervision.

“The operations of data centres that provide services for transactions, e-commerce, media and data storage will not be affected by the restrictions.

“Malaysia will be seen to face challenges in development of the AI data centres but it will not affect the operations of the business ecosystem of these centres,” he said when answering a question raised by Pang Hok Liong (PH-Labis) in Dewan Rakyat yesterday.

On Tuesday, Digital Minister Gobind Singh Deo informed the House that Malaysia had attracted RM114.7bil in investment to develop data centres here.

Meanwhile, Liew noted that Malaysia is among several nations likely to fall under the Tier 2 of the US restriction.

Nations under Tier 2 are deemed not high risk countries but categorised as low risk with regard to access to advanced AI chips.

“Access to advanced AI chips technology will be limited and it’s import controlled.

“Several other Asean nations are also expected to fall under Tier 2 including Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Indonesia and Vietnam,” he added.

Liew pointed out that the US restrictions on the export of advance AI chips has yet to be implemented although the “Export Control Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion” was signed under the Biden administration on Jan 13 this year.

“The framework is currently under public and online engagement process which will take 120 days,” he said.

As such, Liew said that Malaysia will negotiate with the US on the matter. “We also encourage US-based industry players here to negotiate with the US and provide them with feedback,” he added.",Others,2025-02-20,312

MITI said the extension covers the upstream sector of long steel products and that a review of the moratorium period will be carried out once existing domestic players reach nearly 80% capacity utilisation.

""MITI will also extend the moratorium on the upstream sector of flat steel products and limit large capacity expansions. This approach aims, among other things, to address the mismatch between capacity and domestic usage, improve industry practices towards the adoption of emissions compliance technologies, and enhance sector governance to boost competitiveness and the production of high-value-added steel products,"" it said in a statement.

Additionally, MITI recognises the need for strong governance and industry coordination to support the transformation of the industry.

""Therefore, the NIC has agreed to restructure the Malaysia Steel Institute (MSI) and the Malaysian Steel Council (MSC) to strengthen and prioritise their current functions. This restructuring will enhance regulatory enforcement, ensure coordination between key agencies and promote fair competition.

""It will also improve capacity management by increasing transparency and enhancing the competitiveness and economy of the sector. The strengthened institutions will also play an important role in driving the decarbonisation pathway for the steel sector as a whole,"" it said.

The NIC also agreed with MITI's proposal for the government to accelerate the implementation and restructuring of carbon tax and carbon pricing mechanisms for emission-intensive industries, with the steel sector leading the compliance efforts for other sectors.

1561689,Gold scales new high on Trump tariff concerns,"Gold prices rose to a record high on Thursday as investors turned to bullion for safety on fears U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff plans would stoke inflation and a global trade war.

Spot gold was up 0.5% at $2,945.83 an ounce, as of 0621 GMT, after hitting a record high of $2,947.11 earlier in the session.

Bullion has risen 12% so far this year and hit a fresh peak for the tenth time on Trump tariff fears.

U.S. gold futures gained 0.9% to $2,963.80 on Thursday.

""Uncertain outlooks for both global trade and inflation are proving to be conducive for gold and are acting to bring the $3,000 level within range,"" said Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at KCM Trade.

Since his inauguration, Trump has imposed a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and a 25% tariff on steel and aluminium. He said on Wednesday he would announce tariffs related to lumber, cars, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals ""over the next month or sooner.""

Minutes of the Federal Reserve's last policy meeting showed on Wednesday that Trump's initial policy proposals raised concerns about higher inflation and affirmed a continued pause on rate cuts.

Despite chances of fewer rate cuts this year, market participants maintain their overall bullish outlook for gold.

""Gold has and should continue to benefit from robust physical market demand, underpinned by resilient central bank purchases and as physical gold ETFs transition from sellers to marginal buyers,"" said Trevor Yates, analyst at Global X.

Gold is seen as a hedge against geopolitical risks and inflation, but higher interest rates dampen the non-yielding asset's appeal.

""If we look at potential risks which could slow gold prices down, safe-haven demand could dry up somewhat if a peace deal moves closer to fruition between Russia and Ukraine,"" Waterer said.

Trump denounced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as a ""dictator"" on Wednesday and warned he had to move quickly to secure peace or risk losing his country.

The Health Minister said the high rate of infections detected among homosexual and bisexual individuals is due to inconsistent condom use during sexual activities.

""In 2024, a total of 2,037 or 64% out of the 3,185 reported HIV infections were transmitted through homosexual and bisexual relations.

""One of the main factor contributing to the increase in HIV transmission through sexual contact is the irregular use of condoms, especially among high-risk groups,"" he said in a written reply to a question by Datuk Ahmad Saad Yahaya (PN-Pokok Sena) in Dewan Rakyat on Thursday (Feb 20).

He noted that the rise in the use of drugs and illicit substances among some youth poses a challenge as this leads to risky sexual behaviours.

""It leads to behaviour such as not using condoms or engaging in multiple sexual partnerships while under the influence of drugs,"" he added.

He said that ongoing measures including awareness programmes are being taken to curb HIV infections, particularly among high-risk groups.

Among them are regular HIV screening and access to antiretroviral (ARV) treatment to prevent further transmission, he added.

He said that those living with HIV or at risk of infection should seek preventive treatment, such as Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP).

To a question from Nurul Amin Hamid (PN-Padang Terap), Dzulkefly said new HIV infections are on the rise in recent years.

""Overall, there was a reduction of up to 50% between 2000 and 2009.

In a filing with Bursa Malaysia, the construction firm said its outstanding order book now stands at RM5.83bil, with RM4.22bil in new orders secured up to December 2024.

“For 2025, we have set a target order for replenishment ranging from RM4.5bil to RM6bil.”

ICAEW chief executive Alan Vallance said the partnership with SC reaffirms the organisation’s commitment to strengthening regulatory expertise in sustainability across Asean.

“This collaboration will equip regulators with the tools and insights needed to align with global ESG standards while ensuring that regulation remains supportive, not punitive.

“By fostering capacity-building, knowledge-sharing, and sustainable finance innovation, we can work together to build an interconnected, inclusive, and resilient Asean capital market,” he said.

He also noted that trust, ethics, and sustainability must be at the core of capital markets. “Sustainability is not just about compliance – it is a business imperative that drives resilience, innovation, and long-term success,” he said.

Echoing this sentiment, SC chairman Datuk Mohammad Faiz Azmi said with the need to upskill regulators, Malaysia’s Asean chairmanship in 2025 presents an opportunity to drive sustainability and financial resilience.

“Our collaboration with ICAEW ensures we stay ahead of global standards while equipping regulators to support market participants. Together, we can strengthen Asean’s capital markets and investor confidence,” he stated.

1561323,Democratic lawmakers urge Rubio to renew New START nuclear pact with Russia,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Dozens of U.S. Democratic lawmakers on Wednesday urged Secretary of State Marco Rubio to work with Congress to renew a U.S.-Russia nuclear weapons pact that expires next year, saying that even during tense times the agreement has reduced the risk of nuclear war.

The lawmakers, including U.S. Senators Edward Markey, Christopher Murphy and Tammy Baldwin, said the administration of Republican President Donald Trump has a historic opportunity to initiate high-level talks for replacing the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or New START, which expires on February 5, 2026.

The lawmakers said progress can be made even though Russia's President Vladimir Putin is in a three-year-long war with Ukraine.

""We condemn Putin’s nuclear saber-rattling against Ukraine,"" the lawmakers wrote in a letter first reported by Reuters. ""Yet even when our nations have had profound disagreements, including during the Cold War, we managed to come to the table to bring the world back from the precipice of nuclear catastrophe.""

Rubio and other Trump officials met with Russian officials on Tuesday in Riyadh for talks ending the war in Ukraine and agreed to hold more meetings.

The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter and whether the topic of a renewal of New START came up in Riyadh.

In 2010, Moscow and Washington first signed New START, which reduces U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear arsenals with verification. The countries agreed in 2021 to extend the treaty five years.

The Democratic lawmakers said the Trump administration has an opportunity until the nuclear treaty talks reach a deal to mutually agree to respect the limits of New START, using existing means of verification of nuclear arsenals.

""While Russia has agreed to abide by the treaty’s limits, we believe it is in the best interest of both of our nations to pursue formal mechanisms aimed at preventing a nuclear arms race,"" they said.

The lawmakers urged Rubio to work with Congress to replace New START and requested that the State Department hold a congressional briefing on the administration's plan.

1561312,Cubans turn to cooking with charcoal as energy crisis worsens,"SAN NICOLAS DE BARI (Reuters) - For Maria Elena Veiga, a 60-year-old Cuban housewife living on the outskirts of Havana, charcoal has become the go-to fuel for cooking due to frequent blackouts from the island's failing power grid.

""We have opted to cook with charcoal, which is what we can do, because otherwise we are going to go through a lot of work to be able to eat,"" said Veiga, who lives in San Nicolas de Bari, about 60 km (37 miles) northwest of the capital.

Power outages have become a daily reality for many Cubans, with some areas going without electricity for more than 20 hours a day, mainly in towns far from the capital.

""The day is lousy,"" Veiga said. ""There's no power, and gas is scarce.""

A shortage of fuel and the country's aging thermoelectric plants have left Cuba's power supply vulnerable. Most of the oil-fired plants are inactive, and fuel shortages make it difficult for diesel generators to support the national grid.

At the end of last year, several network collapses left the country of some 10 million inhabitants entirely in the dark.

""The electricity is very bad. Sometimes we spend the whole day sometimes without getting power,"" said Mirella Martinez, 72, as she cooked and lightly stirred a pot of beans on top of a small charcoal stove.

Many Cubans struggle with unreliable electricity and an inability to use household appliances. The crisis has prompted the government to implement drastic measures, including a two-day school closure and urging non-essential workers to stay home to reduce consumption.

Cuba blames the U.S. trade embargo for its power grid issues, citing difficulties in acquiring fuel and spare parts for outdated plants.

1561211,EU floats plan to boost arms supplies to Ukraine,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's diplomatic service has proposed boosting the bloc's military aid for Ukraine, aiming to show continued support for Kyiv as the United States and Russia have begun talks about ending the war.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has repeatedly called on his allies to honour all their promises to supply Ukraine with weapons, including those to counter Russian air attacks.

The EU proposal, in a brief paper seen by Reuters, suggests each member state fulfil a financial quota based on the size of its economy to produce a package that would include 1.5 million rounds of artillery ammunition to be delivered this year.

Diplomats held initial talks on the plan - first reported by Politico - this week in Brussels and EU foreign ministers may discuss it on Monday, diplomats said. But no decisions on the proposal are expected at that meeting, they said.

The proposal by the EU's External Action Service does not put an estimated value on the package. But diplomats said the aim was to come up with a plan worth billions of euros.

The proposal says the main goals of the package would be to supply at least 1.5 million rounds of large-calibre artillery ammunition, as well as air defence systems, missiles for deep precision strikes and drones.

It would be largely up to EU governments to fund the package - a potentially significant challenge when many of them are already operating with tight public finances.

However, some of the funding could come from the profits from Russian assets frozen in the EU, the proposal says.

The EU says its members have provided some 48.5 billion euros in military aid to Ukraine since Russia invaded its neighbour in February 2022.

In March 2023, the European Union pledged to supply Ukraine with 1 million artillery shells and missiles within a year but ended up taking more than six months longer than planned to meet that target.

The administration said in the filing that it was complying with U.S. District Judge Amir Ali's temporary restraining order, pointing to a line in the order saying that the U.S. Agency for International Development and the State Department were not barred from ""enforcing the terms of contracts and grants.""

It said it was reviewing the frozen agreements and had determined that all of them allowed the administration to terminate or suspend them, either on their own terms or ""implicitly.""

It also said that USAID and the State Department had legal authority to halt payments that did not depend on President Donald Trump's January 20 executive order freezing foreign aid, which Ali's order barred the administration from enforcing.

The administration asked that, if it had ""misunderstood"" Ali's temporary order, the judge convert it into a longer-term injunction that it would be able to appeal immediately.

Peter Maybarduk of the legal group Public Citizen, which represents the non-profit plaintiffs, in an email called the filing ""outrageous"" and said that ""people who long have been partners of the United States, in vulnerable situations around the world, will suffer as a result of this failure to restore funding, funding the U.S already had promised, and that a court last week ordered the government provide.""",Others,2025-02-20,253
