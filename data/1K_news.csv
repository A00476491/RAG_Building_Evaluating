The Appointments Committee of the Cabinet has approved Pandey’s appointment initially for a period of three years, it said. Pandey would replace Madhabi Puri Buch, whose term ends Feb. 28, as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Board of India.

Pandey will become the second czar from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government to be assigned a powerful role in the financial hub of Mumbai, after his colleague in charge of revenue policies assumed the post of central bank governor a few weeks earlier.

During the next three years, the project will work with stakeholders in urban areas, namely Phnom Penh, Tboung Khmum, Siem Reap, Preah Sihanouk, Kep, Kampot, and Koh Kong.

Speaking at the event, Environment Minister Eang Sophalleth said the rapidly growing volume of plastic waste was adding immense pressure on both waste management system and the environment.

""Plastic now constitutes 20 per cent of the municipal waste stream,"" he said. ""There is, therefore, an urgent need to reduce the volume of plastic use in Cambodia and create an environment where waste is properly managed, recovered, reused, and/or recycled.""

Sophalleth said the project would contribute significantly to the National Circular Strategy on Environment 2023-2028 and would complement corresponding campaigns such as ""Today I don't use plastic bag,"" ""Clean up Cambodia, Khmer can do,"" and ""National Roads Plastic-Free.""

Alissar Chaker, resident representative of the United Nations Development Programme in Cambodia, said plastic pollution was causing the environment to deteriorate and threatening health and wellbeing.

During the event, reportedly attended by 1,000 people, a woman abruptly kissed Jin, on his cheek. Video footage that went viral showed Jin apparently looking uncomfortable.

The woman wrote in an online blog post that ""My lips touched his neck. His skin was so soft,” according to Yonhap news agency.

The latest trip indicates North Korea may be gearing up for a full resumption of its international tourism to bring in much-needed foreign currency to revive its struggling economy, experts say.

The Beijing-based travel company Koryo Tours said it arranged a five-day trip from Feb 20 to Feb 24 for 13 international tourists to the northeastern North Korean border city of Rason, where the country’s special economic zone is located.

Koryo Tours general manager Simon Cockerell said the travellers from the United Kingdom, Canada, Greece, New Zealand, France, Germany, Austria, Australia and Italy crossed by land from China.

He said that in Rason, they visited factories, shops, schools and the statues of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il, the late grandfather and father of current leader Kim Jong-un.

“Since January of 2020, the country has been closed to all tourists, and we are glad to have finally found an opening in the Rason area, in the far north of North Korea,” Cockerell said.

“Our first tour has been and gone, and now more tourists on both group and private visits are going in, arranging trips.”

After the pandemic began, North Korea quickly banned tourists, jetted out diplomats and severely curtailed border traffic in one of the world’s most draconian Covid-19 restrictions.

But since 2022, North Korea has been slowly easing curbs and reopening its borders.

Uchida, 58, told reporters earlier this month that while he was prepared to relinquish his position if asked, he didn’t want to step down before steadying Nissan’s business.

He braced investors for an 80 billion yen net loss for the fiscal year ending in March, a far cry from the 380 billion yen net profit he was forecasting just nine months ago.

Caro Quintero, a co-founder of the Guadalajara Cartel, one of Latin America's most powerful drug trafficking organizations during the 1980s, spent 28 years in prison for the brutal murder and torture of former U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent Enrique ""Kiki"" Camarena, one of the most notorious killings in Mexico's bloody narco wars.

Caro Quintero has previously denied involvement in the killing of Camarena. He was released in 2013 on a technicality by a Mexican judge and returned to trafficking before he was eventually captured by Mexican authorities in 2022.

Mexico on Thursday also extradited Miguel Angel Trevino Morales, known as Z-40, and Oscar Omar Trevino Morales, known as Z-42, two suspected former leaders of the violent Los Zetas drug cartel to the United States, the Webb County Sheriff's Office in Texas said. They were detained by Mexico's military in 2013 and 2015, respectively.

1567733,Russia says it foiled Ukrainian assassination plot against senior Putin-linked Orthodox priest,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) said on Friday it had foiled an attempt by Ukraine's military intelligence service to assasinate Tikhon Shevkunov, a senior priest in Russia's Orthodox Church.

There was no immediate reaction from Kyiv to the allegation.

Shevkunov, who has been described in Russian media reports for years as ""Putin's confessor"" - something he has neither confirmed nor denied - has maintained a public acquaintance with President Vladimir Putin since the late 1990s and the Kremlin has said the two men know each other well.

In 2023, he was appointed metropolitan of Crimea, becoming one of the top Russian Orthodox Church officials on the peninsula, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014.

The FSB said in a statement it had detained one Russian and one Ukrainian man in connection with the plot and had confiscated an improvised explosive device. It said the two suspects, whom it did not name, had confessed.

It said that the two men, who it said had been recruited by Ukraine using the Telegram messenger service, had been plotting the assassination attempt since mid 2024 and had planned to kill Shevkunov in Moscow.

Ukraine has taken responsibility for a number of assassinations in Russia since the start of the war in 2022, including pro-Moscow Ukrainian blogger Vladlen Tatarsky in April 2023, and the head of Russia's Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection Troops, Igor Kirillov, in December 2024.

1567743,"Pope Francis, two weeks into hospital stay, continues slow recovery","VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis, who has been hospitalised for two weeks battling double pneumonia, has spent another peaceful night and is now resting, the Vatican said on Friday.

Francis, 88, was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on February 14 with what was originally described as a bronchitis and was later revealed to have developed into something more serious.

In a medical update on Thursday, the Vatican said the pontiff's condition had ""continued to show improvement"" but his prognosis remained guarded due to a complex clinical picture.

A Vatican official, who did not wish to be named because he was not authorised to discuss the pope's health, noted that Thursday's statement was the second consecutive one that did not describe the pope's condition as ""critical"".

""Maybe we can say he has passed the most critical phase,"" said the official.

Cardinal Michael Czerny, head of the Vatican's human development office, said in an interview with Italy's La Stampa newspaper that Francis was getting better, albeit ""slower than what we would like"".

Francis, who has been pope since 2013, has suffered several bouts of ill health over the past two years. He is prone to lung infections because he developed pleurisy as a young adult and had part of one lung removed.

Double pneumonia is a serious infection of both lungs that can inflame and scar them, making it difficult to breathe. The Vatican said Francis suffered a ""prolonged asthma-like respiratory crisis"" on Saturday, but there have been no repeats.

The island's prefect, Patrice Latron, said there were no reports so far of any deaths.

The cyclone made landfall on the north of the Indian Ocean island, which lies off Madagascar, and was making its way towards the southern part of the island.

The prefecture said 145,000 households - about 30% of the electricity utility's clients - had lost power just an hour after the cyclone hit, and 10% had no access to drinking water.

The prefecture said the worst of the storm had passed and the alert had been downgraded from the highest level, purple, to red. A mandatory order to stay indoors remained in place.

In nearby Mauritius, authorities reopened the airport after the threat from the storm eased.

The move undermines state institutions, touching off a constitutional crisis in ethnically polarised post-war Bosnia. Russia, Dodik's most powerful supporter, said the sentence was politically motivated and would destabilise the Balkans.

The court in Bosnia's capital Sarajevo acted after Dodik

signed Serb Republic legislation suspending rulings by Bosnia's constitutional court and international envoy Christian Schmidt, who oversees implementation of the 1995 Dayton peace treaty.

Dodik, in remarks to lawmakers before they approved the law on Thursday evening, cast the move as an act of secession in defiance of the 1990s peace accord that kept Bosnia intact but split into two autonomous regions largely along ceasefire lines.

""This moment is favourable and I call on you to vote for the law without hesitation,"" the Bosnian Serb nationalist leader told MPs in Banja Luka, the regional capital. ""We think this creates momentum for us to do this without the use of force.""

1567299,"Verizon FAA system puts US air safety at risk, says Starlink owner Musk","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Elon Musk on Thursday said a U.S, Federal Aviation Administration communication system operated by Verizon is months away from failure and putting air safety at risks.

Musk, the world's richest person and a senior adviser to President Donald Trump who is working on restructuring the federal government, owns the Starlink satellite system which is a rival to Verizon's. Verizon operates the largest U.S. wireless network.

""The Verizon communication system to air traffic control is breaking down very rapidly. The FAA assessment is single digit months to catastrophic failure, putting air traveler safety at serious risk,"" Musk, said in a post on social media platform X.

This week, the FAA said it was testing three Starlink terminals at a government facility in Alaska to address concerns about reliable weather information for the aviation community in that state.

""The FAA has been considering the use of Starlink since the prior administration to increase reliability at remote sites, including in Alaska,"" the FAA said this week. The agency did not immediately comment on Musk's tweet.

On Wednesday, the Washington Post reported that the FAA was close to canceling a $2.4 billion contract awarded to Verizon in 2023 to overhaul a communications system, and awarding the work to Musk's Starlink. The FAA said it has not made any decision on the contract.

Verizon did not immediately comment on Musk's remarks. The company said this week company it was at the beginning of a 15-year contract with the FAA ""that will help the agency modernize its technology. Protecting Americans who rely on a safe, secure and functioning air traffic control system is more important than ever, and our enhancements will help make that happen.""

1567447,"Meta in talks to raise $35 billion for data center financing led by Apollo, Bloomberg News reports","(Reuters) -Apollo Global Management is in talks to lead a roughly $35 billion financing package for Meta Platforms to help develop data centers in the U.S., Bloomberg News reported on Thursday citing people with knowledge of the matter.

The alternative asset manager has discussed providing a major part of the financing, according to the report.

Growing computational requirements of artificial intelligence systems have significantly increased the demand for data centers.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg had said in January the company would spend as much as $65 billion this year to expand its AI infrastructure.

The Facebook-parent did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while Apollo Global Management declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.

Meta also plans to invest $10 billion to set up an AI data center in Louisiana, it said in December.

The amount of electricity used by the Meta data center in Louisiana will be matched by renewable energy, for which the tech firm will be working with utility Entergy.

Last week, brokerage TD Cowen said Microsoft canceled leases totaling ""a couple of hundred megawatts"" of capacity with at least two private data-center operators.

It has stoked skepticism among investors due to slow payoffs and breakthroughs at Chinese startup DeepSeek, which showcased AI tech at a much lower cost than its Western rivals.

1567953,Lenovo wins appeal in UK fight with Ericsson over interim patent licence,"LONDON (Reuters) - Lenovo on Friday won an appeal in Britain in its attempt to get an interim licence to use Ericsson's patents, in the latest ruling in the companies' global licensing dispute over 5G wireless technology.

Lenovo sued Ericsson at London's High Court in 2023, one of several cases brought by Lenovo or Ericsson around the world which has seen the companies trade lawsuits in Brazil, Colombia and the United States.

The dispute centres on the fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms for a licence to use Lenovo and Ericsson's patents. Disputes over FRAND licensing have led to global legal battles in the telecom industry.

In London, Lenovo sought a declaration that a willing licensor would agree to a short-term licence pending the final determination of FRAND terms.

Its application was refused last year, but the Court of Appeal overturned that decision on Friday.

Judge Richard Arnold said in a written ruling that ""a willing licensor in the position of Ericsson would enter into an interim licence with Lenovo"", adding that he hoped Ericsson would now choose to do so.

Lenovo's Chief Legal Officer Laura Quatela said the ruling ""not only confirms that Lenovo is a willing licensee but strengthens and reaffirms our commitment to advocating for transparency and fairness in global FRAND licensing"".

Ericsson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The operation is one of the first involving AI-generated child abuse material, Europol said, adding there was a lack of national legislation surrounding the use of AI tools for this purpose.

The main suspect, a Danish national, ran an online platform where he distributed the AI-generated material he produced. Users around the world paid a ""symbolic online payment"" to access the platform.

The operation is ongoing, with authorities from 19 countries including Australia, Spain and the United Kingdom involved.

1567440,Apple accused of greenwashing in US lawsuit,"SAN FRANCISCO: A group of Apple Watch buyers have filed a lawsuit in Silicon Valley accusing the tech giant of exaggerating how environmentally friendly production of the smart wristwear is.

A civil suit filed Feb 26 argues that two nature-based projects Apple cites to back claims of carbon neutrality are areas where trees would be growing regardless of whether the tech company was involved.

""Apple's carbon neutrality claims are false and misleading because both projects fail to provide genuine, additional carbon reductions,"" the suit contends.

Apple, however, rejects the claims, telling AFP Thursday the company had ""drastically cut emissions for Apple Watch by over 75%, and we are investing significantly in nature-based projects to remove hundreds of thousands of metric tons of carbon from the air.""

The US tech giant claims to have retired 485,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents primarily through the Chyulu Hills Project in Kenya and the Guinan Project in China, according to the suit.

The Chyulu Hills Project purports to generate carbon credits by preventing deforestation but is on land that has been legally protected from deforestation since 1983, the suit maintains.

The Guinan Project claims to have planted trees on barren land but the area was already heavily forested before the project began, according to the suit.

Plaintiffs in the case are asking for class-action status to represent everyone who has bought the Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch Ultra 2, or the second-generation Apple Watch SE.

""Companies engage in greenwashing to capitalize on growing environmental consciousness while avoiding the costs and challenges of achieving genuine sustainability,"" the complaint argued.

Meta is battling rivals including Amazon, OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft when it comes to models for powering AI, and has been incrementally weaving the technology into its platforms since launching its own AI chatbot in 2023.

An independent app devoted to AI would fit into Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg's stated vision of having the most used AI assistant in the world.

CNBC cited people familiar with the matter as saying Meta plans to debut a standalone AI app by the middle of this year.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman fired off a post on X, formerly Twitter, with a link to the CNBC story, writing: ""OK, fine maybe we'll do a social app.""

Meta is also planning to test a paid subscription tier for its AI platform, in a revenue generating tactic used by ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, according to the report.

Meta declined to comment for this story.

The tech giant recently reported surging profits and revenue for 2024, announcing ambitious plans to expand its artificial intelligence infrastructure in the year ahead.

""I expect this is going to be the year when a highly intelligent and personalized AI assistant reaches more than 1 billion people, and I expect Meta AI to be that leading Assistant,"" CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on the earnings call.

GPT-4.5 comes with improved ability to recognize patterns, generate creative insights without reasoning and shows greater emotional intelligence, the company said.

Microsoft-backed OpenAI said it would begin rolling out GPT-4.5 to ChatGPT Plus and Team users next week, and then to Enterprise and Edu users the following week.

CEO Sam Altman called it ""a giant, expensive model,"" saying the company ran out of GPU capacity to roll out to user tiers at the same time.

""We will add tens of thousands of GPUs next week ... this isn't how we want to operate, but it's hard to perfectly predict growth surges that lead to GPU shortages,"" he said in a post on X.

OpenAI said the model also has a lower rate of ""hallucinations"", a common issue in which large language models generate false information. At 37.1%, GPT-4.5's hallucination rate compares with the 61.8% shown by GPT-4o and 44% shown by its o1 reasoning model.

Vice President and first lady, Rosario Murillo, called the decision ""sovereign and irrevocable,"" stating Nicaragua would cease participation in all activities related to the Human Rights Council and its ""satellite mechanisms.""

The UN report, released on Wednesday, accuses Ortega and Murillo, who also serves as co-president, of having ""transformed the country into an authoritarian state where no independent institutions remain.""

The UN experts urged legal action against Nicaragua, highlighting human rights abuses in the Latin American country, which they said follow patterns that have been previously established as crimes against humanity.

Ortega's government in the past has ignored reports from the UN and the Organization of American States, which it says are part of an international campaign against it.

Murillo dismissed the UN report as ""falsehoods"" and ""slander.""

Nicaragua experienced mass anti-government protests in 2018 when Ortega's crackdown on dissent resulted in the death of over 350 people and sparked an international outcry over rights abuses.

The UN report also implicated the Nicaraguan army in the violent crackdown, contradicting previous denials.

Martin, who is making the switch to Aprilia this season after leaving Prima Pramac Racing, will miss at least the first two races in Thailand and Argentina.

The 27-year-old also had an operation earlier this month after breaking his right foot and right hand in a crash in Malaysia.

Italian Bagnaia, 28, told reporters ahead of the weekend's season-opening Thailand Grand Prix that he had reached out to Martin via text.

""The only thing that I want to say to him, and I said also to him, is to keep calm, no rush, it's a long recovery and... if he will have another incident before being fully fit he can put his career more at risk,"" twice MotoGP champion Bagnaia said.

""So, sometimes it's better to wait and not rush.""

Bagnaia's new Ducati teammate, six-times MotoGP champion Marc Marquez, has also advised Martin to respect his body.

Bagnaia spoke about his new partnership with Marquez, who has joined the Ducati factory team on a two-year deal after a hugely-successful stint with Honda.

""It's not a secret that we both want to win the championship – we are here for that, and the ambition in our team is to win the championship,"" Bagnaia added. ""So, we will have to do the maximum, I think many times this season we will fight.""

The 2022 world champion was seen with his arm wrapped during a training session at Academy Badminton Malaysia (ABM) in Bukit Kiara on Friday (Feb 28), a day before leaving for France for the Orleans Masters, which begins on Tuesday (March 4).

Aaron dismissed any concerns, explaining that it was an old injury and would not affect his performance in Europe, especially at the prestigious All-England.

“This injury has always been there, whether I train hard or not. The key is how I manage it and prevent it from worsening,"" said Aaron.

“I can confidently say that I am fully fit because we did not compete in any tournaments throughout February and focused entirely on training.

The BBC and Sky Sports reported that Raducanu would be given extra security at Indian Wells, which runs from March 5-16.

Reuters has contacted organisers for comment.

Briton Raducanu looked distressed in her second-round match against Karolina Muchova in the Dubai Championships last week, and stood behind the umpire's chair while the man was led out by security personnel.

She eventually resumed the match and fought back from 4-0 down to force a tiebreak before losing 7-6(6) 6-4.

Dubai Police detained the man following Raducanu's complaint but the player later decided to drop the charges.

The governing body of women's tennis, the WTA, banned the man from all of its tournaments and said it would work with Raducanu and her team to ensure her well-being and provide any support needed.

Raducanu has struggled with form and fitness issues since her 2021 U.S. Open win and sits 55th in the rankings.

Jeffer, who was initially appointed junior head coach at the end of 2023 and promoted to his most recent position last year, said he decided to leave the national body to spend more time with his family in Jakarta.

The Indonesian's contract was supposed to be until November.

""I have decided to leave BAM to spend more time with my wife and three children in Jakarta,"" he said on Friday (Feb 28).

1567452,Soccer-Under pressure Conceicao vows to keep fighting for Milan,"(Reuters) - AC Milan manager Sergio Conceicao admitted the pressure on him was growing after their Serie A loss at Bologna on Thursday but vowed to keep working with the same passion unless the club decide otherwise.

Milan's season is on the brink of unravelling after their Champions League exit and two consecutive Serie A losses which have left them eighth in the standings, eight points behind Juventus in the final top-four spot with 12 rounds left.

Against Bologna, Milan let slip a one-goal and lost 2-1.

""It’s all in our hands. If and when the club feels I’m no longer the right person for Milan, I will step aside, but until that moment, I will continue working with the same passion as always,"" Conceicao told reporters.

""I feel very frustrated because the results are not coming. But I think it’s normal for a coach who works with passion.

""It seems like there is a cloud over Milan that we need to get out of with results, because those are what make the difference.""

Conceicao believes recent media criticism of him is unjustified.

""If I’m no longer needed, I’ll pack my bags and leave without asking for an single euro,"" he said. ""I have nearly 100 Champions League matches, I’ve won 13 trophies. Still people talk about it and say mean things, I have family and neighbours who see what is happening, it’s not fair.""

1567449,Soccer-Leicester's Van Nistelrooy finds no safety in numbers,"LONDON (Reuters) - The statistics tell a damning story of Ruud Van Nistelrooy's reign as Leicester City manager and they got worse after a limp Premier League loss to West Ham United on Thursday.

Since taking the helm from Steve Cooper in late November, Van Nistelrooy has won only two of 14 league matches and has now lost 11 of the last 12.

The former Netherlands striker netted 95 Premier League goals for Manchester United but his Leicester side have now gone four league games without scoring, conceding 12 in that time.

He cut a gloomy figure at the London Stadium watching a 2-0 lost to West Ham and the question now is whether he will still be on the touchline when they travel to Chelsea on March 9.

""What do you want me to say?,"" Van Nistelrooy replied when asked whether he expected to still be in charge. ""I keep working, I keep going.""

Leicester are 19th in the table, level with Ipswich but behind them on goal difference and five points adrift of 17th-placed Wolverhampton Wanderers.

""We know the situation we're in, we know the table,"" Van Nistelrooy said. ""We know how quick football can turn around.""

Leicester did muster more attacking intent in the second half which pleased their manager.

""I saw two different halves. I saw a first half where we tried not to lose, and another half where we tried to win,"" Van Nistelrooy said.

Their defence remains a glaring weakness, however, with only one clean sheet all season and 61 goals conceded.

1567442,Soccer-Fenerbahce's Mourinho banned and fined for referee comments,"(Reuters) - Fenerbahce manager Jose Mourinho was handed a four-match ban and fined by the Turkish Football Federation (TFF) on Thursday following his comments about Turkish referees after a match at Galatasaray.

The TFF fined the 62-year-old Portuguese 1,617,000 Turkish lira ($44,000) after he criticised the match officials in a press conference following the 0-0 Super Lig draw on Monday.

The penalties were due to ""derogatory and offensive statements towards the Turkish referee"" and accusations of chaos and disorder in Turkish football, the TFF said.

The TFF said Mourinho's remarks violated sports ethics, promoted violence and disorder and could incite fan incidents.

Monday's game was refereed by Slovenian Slavko Vincic after both clubs requested a foreign official take charge.

Fenerbahce issued a statement on Tuesday defending Mourinho, saying his comments were taken out of context and deliberately distorted.

Former Chelsea, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur manager Mourinho has previously been fined and suspended for his comments about Turkish match officials.

Earlier, she had no trouble clearing the qualifying round, defeating Spain’s Clara Azurmendi.

This marks Kisona’s second early-round exit this year, following a similar fate at the Thailand Masters in January, where she bowed out in the second round to Indonesia’s Putri Kusuma Wardani.

Since leaving the Badminton Association of Malaysia (BAM) in 2022, Kisona has struggled to regain top form. However, she ended her title drought last year by clinching the Dutch Open in October.

Even more notably, two months later, she teamed up with Yap Rui Chen in women’s doubles and secured the Nepal International title.

Milan are eighth in the standings with 41 points, eight behind Juventus in fourth with 12 rounds remaining. Bologna are sixth on 44.

It was the first time in nearly 23 years that Bologna had won a home match against Milan in Serie A. The match was originally scheduled for October but was called off due to flooding.

Two minutes before halftime, Rafael Leao pounced on a flick-on, breezed past his marker and rounded Bologna keeper Lukasz Skorupski to put Milan ahead.

Bologna equalised three minutes after the restart when a free kick into the box was headed down to Santiago Castro who finished from close range.

Milan protested, claiming the ball had ricocheted off Bologna's Giovanni Fabbian's arm before reaching Castro, but VAR allowed the goal to stand.

Yunus Musah nearly put Milan ahead again just after the hour mark, but Skorupski made a crucial save.

Bologna gradually took control of the match as Milan's defence appeared to lose focus, Nicolo Casale heading against the post from a corner before Nicolo Cambiaghi sent the rebound over the bar.

The turnaround was complete nine minutes from time when Nicolo Cambiaghi reached the byline and sent in a cross that Dan Ndoye, at full stretch, tapped into the net.

1567409,Rugby-Ireland centre Ringrose to miss Six Nations clash with France after suspension,"(Reuters) - Ireland will be without Garry Ringrose for their crucial Six Nations clash with France after the centre's red card against Wales was upheld by a disciplinary committee on Thursday, but he should be available for the final game against Italy.

Ringrose received a yellow card, later upgraded to a 20-minute red on bunker review, for a dangerous tackle on Wales centre Ben Thomas that resulted in head-on-head contact, in Ireland's 27-18 win last Saturday.

The disciplinary committee determined that the mid-range entry point of six weeks/matches was appropriate, but after the player accepted committing an act of foul play, they applied the maximum 50% reduction.

That three week/game ban will be cut to two once Ringrose takes part in World Rugby’s Coaching Intervention Programme, which would make him available for Ireland's final Six Nations game against Italy.

Along with the France game on March 8, Ringrose will miss this weekend's United Rugby Championship game for Leinster against Cardiff.

Ireland lead the Six Nations standings after three wins from three and are still on course for the Grand Slam but with France three points behind in second, the French could still win the championship.

1567407,Juventus returns to first-half profit after Champions League return,"MILAN (Reuters) - Juventus on Thursday swung to a 17 million euro ($18 million) profit in the first half of its fiscal year, as the Italian soccer club's return to Europe's lucrative elite club competition Champions League boosted revenues.

The result compares with a loss of 95 million euros in the same period a year earlier. The company does not expect to post a net profit in the full year, despite a strong improvement at the operating level. Juventus' fiscal year runs from July 1 to June 30.

Operating revenue at the Turin-based club rose 29% to 224 million euros between July and December last year.

Juventus pocketed 69 million euros from Champions League's broadcasting rights and ticket sales, which helped it to offset in part the end of its front jersey sponsorship contract with auto brand Jeep, which is yet to be replaced by a new deal.

The US CBP issued the WRO against the palm oil and palm oil products of FGV and its subsidiaries and joint ventures on Sept 30, 2020, barring entry of these products to the US.

Group chief executive officer Fakhrunniam Othman said FGV is waiting for the agency's response after submitting additional clarifications on labour compliance in mid-February 2025.

""We have submitted the petition to modify the WRO in June of last year. After that, the US CBP engaged with FGV to get additional information on specific issues relating to labour compliance according to the Malaysian laws,” he said.

In addition, group chief financial officer Datuk Mohd Hairul Abdul Hamid said that among the key clarifications sought by US CBP were the working hours and aspects related to the Malaysian immigration laws concerning foreign workers.

""There are certain clarifications that have been requested in terms of the overtime, because if you look at international labour standards, your overtime cannot exceed 60 hours per week whereas in Malaysia, it is up to 104 hours.

""So, they need confirmation on whether FGV has complied with the Malaysian law,” he said.

ECB employees are likely to complete their analysis of UniCredit’s purchase of 29.9% of Commerzbank by early March, setting the stage for approval by the regulator’s Supervisory Board later in the month, the source said.

The most recent briefing from the ECB’s supervisory experts, which included different scenarios to evaluate the banks’ solidity, was positive, the source added.

Spokespeople for the ECB, Commerzbank and UniCredit declined to comment.

UniCredit chief executive officer Andrea Orcel, a prolific dealmaker, shocked Germany’s corporate and political establishment by snapping up shares in Commerzbank in September.

He went on to build up the holding in the face of widespread German opposition while pressing for a full tie-up.

The ECB signing off on UniCredit owning just shy of 30% in Commerzbank would clear a significant regulatory hurdle.

Orcel has signalled the need for support from the German government for a full takeover to proceed, a move Commerzbank’s own management has called “hostile”.

1566516,Soccer-Sesko penalty gives Leipzig 1-0 win over Wolfsburg and spot in German Cup last four,"LEIPZIG, Germany (Reuters) - RB Leipzig needed a well-taken second-half penalty from forward Benjamin Sesko to edge VfL Wolfsburg 1-0 on Wednesday and reach the German Cup last four.

Leipzig, back-to-back German Cup winners in 2022 and 2023, soaked up early Wolfsburg pressure in both halves before gradually improving.

They bagged the winner in the 69th minute when keeper Marius Mueller went the wrong way as Slovenia forward Sesko took his penalty, awarded for hand ball.

Both teams came close late in the game with Sesko's close-range effort saved before Wolfsburg, who had hit the woodwork with Mohamed Amoura's header three minutes after the restart, missed a chance with Kevin Behrens.

Leipzig join holders Bayer Leverkusen and VfB Stuttgart in the last four, as well as third-tier Arminia Bielefeld who stunned Werder Bremen 2-1 on Tuesday.

The 'strategic overhaul', doubling the current minimum, was approved by the FIA's World Motor Sport Council at its first meeting of the year.

""Following recent discussions in the F1 Commission, a specific requirement for the Monaco GP has been approved mandating the use of at least three sets of tyres in the race,"" the FIA said.

A minimum of two different tyre compounds will have to be used if the race is dry.

Overtaking is extremely difficult around the Mediterranean principality, with qualifying and pole position even more crucial than at other races.

""Monaco is super-exciting on a Saturday, for us drivers it’s incredible, it’s the best qualifying of the year,"" Ferrari's Monegasque driver Charles Leclerc said last week after the measure was discussed by the F1 Commission.

""Then on the Sunday it can get a little bit... there's not much happening. So I think this is a way to spice things up a bit more.""

In an interview with Fox News Tuesday night, Gabbard described their use of the National Security Administration tool as “an egregious violation of trust” that went against “basic rules and standards around professionalism.”

“I put out a directive today that they will all be terminated and their security clearances will be revoked,” Gabbard said.

Conservative activist Chris Rufo, who writes for City Journal, first disclosed the news Tuesday.

A spokesperson for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said on X Tuesday that Gabbard had sent a memo directing all intelligence agencies to identify the employees who participated in the “‘obscene, pornographic, and sexually explicit’ chatrooms’” by Friday.

In her Fox News interviews, Gabbard said that the administration would continue to ""clean house.""

The office has in recent weeks also moved to fire employees who led diversity initiatives in the Biden administration. It is not clear how many people throughout the intelligence community have been told that they will be fired. That effort has temporarily paused as a federal judge reviews the legality of the move.

1566966,Internet celebrity Andrew Tate leaves Romania-report,"BUCHAREST (Reuters) -Internet personality Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan left Romania on a private flight for the United States early on Thursday, news website G4media.ro said citing airport sources.

The Tate brothers are under criminal investigation in Romania on accusations of forming an organised criminal group, human trafficking, trafficking of minors, sexual intercourse with a minor and money laundering. They have denied all wrongdoing.

The Financial Times reported last week, citing sources, that members of U.S. President Donald Trump's administration had pressured Romanian authorities to lift travel restrictions on the Tates, former kickboxers with dual U.S. and British citizenship.

Tate's lawyer and communication team did not immediately comment on the report the Tates had left the country.

Romania's Foreign Minister Emil Hurezeanu said the Tates were mentioned during his brief hallway meeting with Trump’s special envoy Richard Grenell at the Munich Security Conference earlier this month.

Pending the criminal investigation, the Tates are under judicial control, a light preventative measure under which they are required to check in with the police regularly.

Until this week, they were also banned from leaving Romania, a measure prosecutors said they lifted.

""The request to change the obligation of not leaving Romania was approved,"" prosecutors said in a statement on Thursday.

""All the other obligations have been maintained, including the requirement to check in with judicial authorities every time they are called.""

A first criminal case against Tate and his brother failed in December when a Bucharest court decided not to start the trial and sent the files back to prosecutors citing flaws in the indictment.

The court's advocate-general said Austria had been correct in arguing that the Commission should have examined whether the direct award of the construction contract to Russian company Nizhny Novgorod Engineering was compatible with EU procurement rules.

Opinions of the advocate-general are non-binding, but ECJ judges, who are expected to rule on the case in the coming months, typically follow the majority of them.

Austria launched its appeal at the European Union's top court in 2022 after the bloc's second-highest court dismissed Vienna's case.

Austria sued the EU executive in 2018 for its approval of Hungary's plan to build two new reactors at its Paks nuclear site, south of Budapest, with Russian help following Hungarian authorities' promise to take several measures to ensure fair competition.

Advocate-General Laila Medina said the award of the construction contract had been an ""inextricable part"" of the state aid, which the Commission should have taken into account.

1567188,"French pension system must return to balance by 2030, PM says","PARIS (Reuters) - Pension negotiations between French unions and employers must chart a path for steering the retirement system's finances back to balance by the end of the decade, Prime Minister Francois Bayrou said on Thursday.

Unions and employers federations began talks on Thursday to modify a deeply unpopular 2023 pension overhaul that gradually raises the retirement age two years to 64.

""Negotiators' objective should be to bring the retirement system's finances back to balance in the near future while proposing real improvements for citizens,"" Bayrou said in a letter to participants seen by Reuters.

""I would like to set a target of 2030,"" he added.

To set the stage for the talks, the independent audit office said last week that France could ill afford to scrap the 2023 reform, which it estimated would cost 13 billion euros ($13.6 billion).

Even with the 2023 reform, the shortfall between pension contributions from workers and employers and payouts to retirees would reach 15 billion euros by 2035 if nothing more is done to reduce it, the audit office said.

Unions want to scrap the increase in the retirement age while business federations want to avoid additional payroll contributions that would increase the cost of labour.

Bayrou, a long-time debt hawk, has said all options are on the negotiating table between unions and employers, including the retirement age, as long as any changes do not leave the pension system deeper in the red.

1566358,Chinese firms ramp up tech industry expansion,"HANGZHOU: Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) startup DeepSeek launched its Open Source Week initiative and released its first code repository FlashMLA on Monday to share its “small but sincere progress with full transparency”.

FlashMLA is an optimisation tool that makes large language models faster and more efficient, especially for high-performance AI tasks.

It accelerates the decoding process, improving response time and throughput, crucial for real-time tasks such as chatbots and text generation.

Previously, DeepSeek, based in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, announced that it would release five code repositories in succession, sharing their research progress with the global developer community in a completely transparent manner.

On the same day, Alibaba Group announced that it will invest more than 380 billion yuan in building cloud and AI hardware infrastructure in the next three years, capitalising on the rapid growth of the AI industry.

The explosive AI growth has far exceeded expectations while the booming domestic science and technology industry has shown huge potential, said Alibaba Group chief executive officer Eddie Wu.

“Alibaba will spare no effort to accelerate the construction of cloud and AI hardware infrastructure to promote the development of the whole industry.”

Chinese companies have rapidly expanded in emerging sectors like AI, demonstrating impressive growth and strategic foresight.

Many technology firms are now making their mark on the global stage.

The group’s performance is expected to be supported by continued growth in retail customers for its Unifi services, continuing digitalisation in the country and expansion of the regional submarine cable network.

The group, which released its results for the fourth quarter ended Dec 31 (4Q24) and the full year (FY24) on Tuesday, estimates revenue growth to be in single digits percentage-wise for FY25.

Kenanga Research, which maintained an “outperform” call on the stock, said the investment case for TM included the group taking advantage of trends such as the country’s ongoing digital transformation, the upcoming second phase of the Jendela national Internet network, data centres enabling earnings accretion, and higher demand for data transmission through its digital network of submarine cables and domestic fibre-optic lines.

The research house tweaked its FY25 earnings forecast for TM higher by 2% and raised the target price to RM8.07 from RM7.53 as the company expects extra capacity from existing cables being upgraded and completed by 3Q25.

The Seattle-based chain started laying off workers, a move that chief executive officer Brian Niccol said would increase efficiency and reduce complexity as he tries to reverse a sales slump.

Now, Starbucks’ tech group will turn to third-party workers for certain tasks.

“We are realigning our resource mix of internal and outsourced talent,” according to a memo from Deb Hall Lefevre, Starbucks’ chief technology officer.

The goal is to shift full-time workers to the company’s most important initiatives, according to the memo, while leaning on service providers for “speed and agility”.

Starbucks declined to specify how many roles would be outsourced and to what third-party provider.

An in-house technology team will still exist while external talent will be used for more routine work, according to the firm.

Francesco Pellegrino of Italy took silver and Finland's Lauri Vuorinen the bronze in the men's race, while Norway's Kristine Stavaas Skistad claimed silver and Nadine Faehndrich won a surprise bronze for Switzerland in the women's event.

In front of thousands of cheering Norwegian supporters, Klaebo seemed unfazed as he waited at the start, and he quickly settled into his rhythm at the front of the field in pursuit of his fourth straight world title.

He briefly allowed Pellegrino to set the pace before easing past him around the halfway point and attacking on a punishing uphill stretch, building up just enough of a lead to hold off the strong challenge of the Italian.

Realising he couldn't be caught on the final straight, Klaebo eased up before the finish line to celebrate with the jubilant crowd as he finished in a time of two minutes 45.74 seconds, 0.67 seconds ahead of Pellegrino.

Finland's Vuorinen, who has previously only made two individual podiums in his 12-year career, had the race of his life as he held off the challenge of France's Jules Chappaz to claim the bronze by a margin of two-tenths of a second.

In the women's race, Swedish sprint queen Sundling dominated en route to her third straight world title, bursting out of the gate in a furious start before taking over and accelerating away to win in a time of three minutes 3.36 seconds, 2.2 seconds ahead of Norway's Stavaas Skistad.

The float shows Klopp, a former Mainz 05 player and coach, with wings made of banknotes and holding a can of Red Bull's trademark energy drink along with a football.

""For Kloppo values ​​​​he no longer cares about, used to matter. Because Red Bull lures with a lot of money, he is now falling off his pedestal with a crash,"" the float says on its side.

The Mainz great, who went on to have successful coaching spells at Borussia Dortmund and Liverpool, joined Red Bull this year as head of their global soccer operations, with clubs in Brazil, United States, Austria, France and Germany, much to the disappointment of Mainz fans.

Some Mainz fans are critical of Klopp's decision to join Red Bull, that also owns Bundesliga club RB Leipzig, saying it was financially driven.

RB Leipzig's rapid rise through the divisions a decade ago to reach the Bundesliga thanks to the energy drinks maker's considerable investment was unpopular with many German fans.

The Group A match between the two eliminated sides was of little consequence and steady drizzle poured cold water on defending champions Pakistan's hopes of a consolation victory.

Tuesday's Group B fixture between Australia and South Africa at the same venue was also abandoned without a ball being bowled because of rain.

It has been a forgettable campaign for Mohammad Rizwan-led Pakistan in the first global tournament to be staged in the country since 1996 and their six-wicket defeat by arch-rivals India will particularly hurt.

""The expectations are very high. We didn't perform well and it is disappointing for us,"" Rizwan said.

""We made mistakes in the last few games. Hopefully, we can learn from these. We are next going to New Zealand and hopefully we can perform there.""

Bangladesh also finished their winless campaign with a point.

""We really wanted to play this match, but can't do anything about the weather,"" Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto said.

He drew positives from the display of their pace trio Nahid Rana, Taskin Ahmed and Mustafizur Rahman.

""We have always struggled with our fast bowling unit, but in the last few years a lot of fast bowlers are coming through,"" Shanto said.

""The likes of Taskin and Rana coming in and 'Fizz' is there. We have a very good bowling attack.""

Former Ireland international Jones played a vital role in helping the Springboks to their World Cup success in 2019 and 2023 but left to become defence coach with Steve Borthwick’s England after South Africa's latter triumph in France.

Jones quit inside a year but was asked to see out his notice period, which expired in December.

""He was a vital cog in the coaching team from 2019 to 2023, and his experience, professionalism, and excellent work ethic will make him a great addition to the fantastic coaching team we built from the beginning of 2024,"" Springbok head coach Rassie Erasmus said in a statement.

Jones will be one of six assistants to Erasmus, along with former New Zealand international Tony Brown, ex-Ireland hooker Jerry Flannery, Deon Davids, Mzwandile Stick and scrum coach Daan Human.

They will play tests against Italy in Pretoria on July 5 and Gqeberha (formerly Port Elizabeth) a week later, before welcoming Georgia to Nelspruit on July 19.

The two Rugby Championship home fixtures with Australia will be played in Johannesburg on August 16 and the following week in Cape Town.

The naturally aspirated V10s, which disappeared from the starting grid in 2006, are far louder than the current V6 turbo-hybrid units but are being mooted as a future option with sustainable fuel.

The governing FIA said last week that discussions were ongoing with stakeholders over the sport's technical direction from 2030 and a working group was likely to be set up to explore all possibilities.

""Personally, from a sporting perspective, looking at what the future engine of Formula One should be beyond this next generation, particularly with the way that sustainable fuel is going, it does open up all kinds of opportunities,"" said Horner.

""Inadvertently, we’ve ended up with a very, very expensive, very complex engine from '26 onwards.

1566767,Cricket-Coach Trott says Afghanistan will never be taken lightly again,"(Reuters) - Afghanistan's performances at the 50-overs and Twenty20 World Cups mean there is no chance of Australia taking them lightly in Friday's Champions Trophy match, particularly with a place in the semi-finals on the line, coach Jonathan Trott said.

Afghanistan beat England by eight runs in Lahore on Wednesday to stay in the hunt for a berth in the last four, underlining their strength in limited-overs cricket.

Trott's side beat England, Pakistan and Sri Lanka to finish sixth at the 50-overs World Cup in 2023 and followed that up by making the semi-finals of the T20 edition last year, beating Australia along the way.

""It's all on the line, and since I've been coach we've played against Australia three times and we've been in the game in each of those games,"" former England batter Trott told reporters.

""We should take a lot of confidence from that ... certainly what happened in the World Cup, T20 World Cup, and I say this to the players as well, that Afghanistan's never going to be taken lightly ever again.

""We've got to be prepared because I know Australia aren't going to take us lightly. In the past, perhaps people would have seen the fixture and thought it was a little bit easier than playing a historic test nation.

""In this format, in these conditions, I don't see that. Every game that we play is going to be competitive and every game we go into I expect to win.""

Trott said there was a rawness to the team when he took over in 2022 but they have grown with experience.

Kuhnemann was cleared to resume international cricket on Wednesday following an independent assessment at the National Cricket Centre in Brisbane.

The 28-year-old left-arm spinner was reported after the second test in Galle, having topped the wickets list for the series with 16 dismissals at an average of 17.18.

""I’m looking forward to finishing the season with Tasmania once my thumb has fully healed and then getting into my off-field preparations.""

Kuhnemann had never previously been reported in more than 100 professional matches dating back to 2017.

This week's talks in Cape Town were overshadowed by the absence of several key finance chiefs and foreign aid cuts by major economies like the United States and Britain.

Disputes over trade, the Ukraine war and how to tackle climate change have long made it hard for the G20 grouping to make serious progress on global challenges.

South Africa's Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana said he was ""not happy"" the G20 meeting could not issue a joint communique.

The chair's summary - which has become a feature of multilateral meetings in which participants do not reach a formal consensus - said the G20 supported a rules-based trading system with the World Trade Organization at its core.

U.S. media have said Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the world's largest contract chipmaker and a major supplier to companies such as Apple and Nvidia, has been in talks for a stake in Intel.

Neither company has confirmed the talks, but U.S. President Donald Trump has criticised Taiwan for taking away American semiconductor business and says he wants the industry back in his country.

Speaking to reporters in Taipei, Kuo said that ""no one can shake the foundations"" of Taiwan's semiconductor industry.

""We have to have confidence in TSMC, and the government will fully support the 'sacred mountain protecting the country,"" he added, using an expression that refers both to the importance of the chip sector and TSMC to Taiwan's economy.

The government will not interfere in TSMC's decisions, Kuo said.

""For TSMC to go into the world and have a joint venture in any location, it definitely needs government permission,"" he added.

Large overseas investments need to be approved by Taiwan's economy ministry.

TSMC is already in the process of investing $65 billion in new factories in the U.s. state of Arizona.

Taiwan, which runs a large trade surplus with the United States, could also be subject to wide-ranging import tariffs Trump has threatened to impose to deal with trade imbalances.

Kuo said the ministry was collecting information for government negotiators to talk to the Trump administration on the tariffs issue to seek the best conditions for Taiwanese companies, but he declined to comment on the contents of the talks.

The group expects full-year revenue between 530 million euros and 600 million euros ($554.65 million to $627.90 million) in 2025, down from 633.2 million euros a year earlier.

That compares with analysts' estimate of 582 million euros, according to LSEG data.

Chip companies have been under pressure as higher demand from artificial intelligence (AI) has failed to offset weak demand for automotive, PC and memory chips.

U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to impose 25% tariffs on cars, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, which could disrupt the global supply chain, has raised concerns globally.

""Consensus expectations for 2025 have remained inflated but investors already expected a significant sales decline, in our view, given the negative news flow on silicon carbide over past months,"" Stifel analyst Juergen Wagner said in a note.

Aixtron shares felll around 10% in morning trade, putting them on track for their worst day since February 2024 and down down 14.4% so far this year.

Aixtron also said it expects first-quarter revenue between 90 million and 110 million euros, down from 118.3 million euros in the same period last year.

Full-year earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) dropped to 131.2 million euros from 156.8 million a year earlier.

1567173,Meta fixes error that flooded Instagram Reels with violent videos,"(Reuters) - Meta Platforms said on Thursday it had resolved an error that flooded the personal Reels feeds of Instagram users with violent and graphic videos worldwide.

It was not immediately clear how many people were affected by the glitch. Meta's comments followed a wave of complaints on social media about violent and ""not safe for work"" content in Reels feeds, despite some users having enabled the ""sensitive content control"" setting meant to filter such material.

""We have fixed an error that caused some users to see content in their Instagram Reels feed that should not have been recommended. We apologize for the mistake,"" a spokesperson for Meta said.

It did not disclose the reason behind the error.

Meta's moderation policies have come under scrutiny after it decided last month to scrap its U.S. fact-checking program on Facebook, Instagram and Threads, three of the world's biggest social media platforms with more than 3 billion users globally.

Violent and graphic videos are prohibited under Meta's policy and the company usually removes such content to protect users, barring exceptions given for videos that raise awareness on topics including human rights abuse and conflict.

The company has in recent years been leaning more on its automated moderation tools, a tactic that is expected to accelerate with the shift away from fact-checking in the United States.

Meta has faced criticism for failing to effectively balance content recommendations and user safety, as seen in incidents like the spread of violent content during the Myanmar genocide, Instagram promoting eating disorder content to teens and misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic.

1567175,Japan's Idemitsu to build lithium sulphide plant to help support Toyota's EV plans,"ANEGASAKI, Japan (Reuters) - Japan's No.2 oil refiner, Idemitsu Kosan <5019.T> plans to build a large-scale plant for lithium sulphide, a key material for all-solid-state batteries, at its Chiba refinery, near Tokyo, the company said on Thursday.

Automakers and battery suppliers worldwide are racing to develop solid-state batteries, touted as crucial for longer-lasting, safer, and more affordable EVs amid slowing EV growth.

The project builds on Idemitsu's partnership with Toyota Motor to commercialise next generation batteries and support the automaker's goal of launching electric vehicles with all-solid-state batteries by 2027-2028.

Toyota aims to introduce the batteries to drastically improve the driving range of EVs. Solid-state batteries also offer shorter charging times than traditional lithium-ion packs.

Idemitsu plans to complete the new plant by June 2027, with an estimated cost of 21.3 billion yen ($143 million).

The facility will have a production capacity of 1,000 metric tons of lithium sulphide annually — enough to supply solid electrolyte for 50,000–60,000 EVs, Idemitsu Executive Officer Tetsuji Mishina told reporters at the Chiba refinery.

Idemitsu plans to make a final investment decision on building a large-scale pilot factory for solid electrolyte, a key ingredient for solid-state batteries, in the fiscal year 2025, which ends in March 2026, Mishina said.

It is also seeking stable lithium supplies from Australia and other overseas sources.

""A major challenge for global adoption of solid-state batteries is lowering solid electrolyte costs,"" Mishina said, with the aim to reduce costs so they match those of liquid lithium-ion batteries.

Idemitsu plans to supply solid electrolyte to Toyota first, expanding to other customers later. The company is currently developing two different types of solid electrolyte, Mishina said.

Called App Tracking Transparency (ATT), the feature allows iPhone users to decide which apps can track user activity, helping companies like Meta Platforms' Facebook and online advertisers tailor ads to users and measure their impact.

Digital advertising and mobile gaming companies including Facebook say it has made it more expensive and difficult for brands to advertise on Apple's platforms.

The French regulator charged Apple in 2023, saying it was concerned that the company might ""abuse its dominant position by implementing discriminatory, non-objective and non-transparent conditions for the use of user data for advertising purposes"".

It is expected to issue its decision next month ordering Apple to halt its anti-competitive practice and will likely impose a fine too, the people said, making it the first regulatory veto against the ATT.

French antitrust fines can be as much as 10% of a company's global annual revenue.

""The decision is expected in the spring. But we can't comment any further,"" the regulator said.

Apple referred to a July 2023 statement in which it said it holds its advertising business to a higher standard of privacy than it requires of any other developer and that it had previously received strong support from the French regulator and privacy watchdog on the goal of the ATT.

The German antitrust authority earlier this month charged Apple with abusing its market power through its app tracking tool and giving itself preferential treatment, putting the company at risk of a hefty fine.

1566360,China’s travel costs drop in off-peak season,"BEIJING: The domestic tourism market has entered an off-peak period with declining prices of hotel rooms and flight tickets, providing travellers with the opportunity to take trips that cost less and feature smaller crowds.

After the Spring Festival holiday, the passenger flow of popular domestic tourist cities in various regions has gradually declined, and the prices of flights have dropped accordingly.

For instance, a one-way flight from Beijing to Chengdu, Sichuan province; Lanzhou, Gansu province; or Harbin, Heilongjiang province, all carry a price tag of around 200 yuan, excluding airport construction fees and fuel costs.

A one-way flight from Beijing to Haikou or Sanya, in the tropical island of Hainan province, is around 300 yuan, according to Qunar, a Beijing-based online travel agency.

The elderly who have flexible schedules often embark on trips during this period, and they prefer independent travel and choose destinations largely based on prices.

In-depth tours of Yunnan province, Fujian province, and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area have been favoured by senior travellers, Qunar said.

“The tourism market has entered a long slack season and it will last until the next holiday, which is Qingming Festival, also known as Tomb-Sweeping Day in early April,” said Qunar researcher Xiao Peng.

“March will be a period that is inexpensive and not crowded, suitable for college students, senior travellers and office employees who take annual holidays off work to travel.”

At 6 pm, the ringgit fell to 4.4410/4480 from 4.4260/4305 at Wednesday’s close.

Bank Muamalat Malaysia Bhd chief economist Dr Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid observed that the ringgit was generally weaker against the greenback, just shy of the immediate resistant level of RM4.45.

He also noted that Asian currencies were also weaker against the US dollar.

The decline in the US Treasury yields and the lacklustre performance in the global equities market suggest that risk-off mode may have prevailed. The 10-year US Treasury yield has declined by 33 basis points to 4.25 per cent.

""Such market conditions would typically benefit the US dollar as traders and investors were seeking refuge against market volatility, along with the ongoing net foreign fund outflows in Malaysian equities indicate that foreign investors’ risk appetite has gone down and becomes defensive.

""As such, the ringgit is currently flirting towards its immediate resistant level of RM4.45 owing to risk aversion sentiments in the financial market,” he told Bernama.

Meanwhile, the ringgit was traded weaker against major currencies.

It was slightly weaker against the Japanese yen to 2.9634/9683 from 2.9631/9663, declined against the British pound to 5.6303/6392 from 5.5993/6050, and fell against the euro to 4.6559/6633 from 4.6455/6503.

Interestingly, in an interview with StarBizWeek in September 2023, KNM chairman Tunku Datuk Yaacob Khyra said KNM will have a better deal by floating Borsig compared to an outright sale.

“If we go for a direct sale, we would get a lower valuation, for example about seven times price-to-earnings (PE) ratio.

“Instead, by listing Borsig, we would get a PE of 15 times and with that, a much higher sale proceeds,” he said then.

Tunku Yaacob’s plan to list Borsign on the Singapore Stock Exchange did not take place.

1566346,Amazon's Prime to exclusively stream New York Yankees season games amid live sports push,"(Reuters) - Amazon said on Wednesday it will exclusively stream 21 New York Yankees regular games on its Prime Video service for the upcoming 2025 season, as streaming companies face increasing competition to broadcast live sporting events.

The baseball games will be live streamed at no extra cost to Prime Video members living in New York State, Connecticut, north and central New Jersey and northeast Pennsylvania — areas that cover a majority of the fanbase of the New York Yankees.

Live sports, a prerogative of cable television for decades, is swiftly moving to digital platforms to tap the larger audience that is ditching cable TV subscriptions for digital streaming platforms.

Streaming bellwether Netflix has increased its investments towards acquiring live sports content, including high-profile events such as the Mike Tyson-Jake Paul boxing match, aiming to diversify its portfolio and attract a broader audience.

It also paid more than $5 billion to be the exclusive home of World Wrestling Entertainment's Raw in several territories from January this year and is considering a bid for Formula 1's U.S. TV rights, according to media reports.

This has prompted competing digital platforms, including Prime Video, to stream more live sporting events to drive subscriber growth and enhance their advertising revenue, as live events tend to draw large, engaged audiences.

Prime Video currently streams the NBA, Thursday Night Football, NASCAR, Seattle Kraken and Overtime Elite among others in the U.S.

1566750,MP calls for inquest into 2022 death of industrial trainee,"KUALA LUMPUR: A Member of Parliament has called for an inquest without further delay over the death of industrial trainee Muhammad Atif Abu Bakar in December 2022.

Petaling MP Lee Chean Chung said the Attorney General's Chambers had indicated that an inquest would be held via a letter dated Nov 17 last year to the lawyers representing Atif's family.

However, Atif’s father Abu Bakar Ja'afar has yet to receive any communication from the authorities about the inquest, Lee told a press conference here on Thursday (Feb 27).

He said the inquest under the Criminal Procedure Code should be conducted immediately as the family must be told of the circumstances of Atif's death.

On Dec 18, 2022, the body of 20-year-old Atif was found in a surau in Mersing, Johor.

A post-mortem determined the cause of death to be traumatic asphyxia, with 53 marks of injury found.

“Atif's family believes that he was beaten to death by persons unknown,"" Lee said, adding that they initially hoped the police investigation would shed light on the matter.

He said that after waiting for two years, the family had not received any updates from the police and claimed the case had been classified as ""no further action"" or NFA without a clear explanation given.

Lee added that failure to resolve the case constituted a breakdown in the administration of justice.

The family made a High Court filing in Johor to compel the inquest, but the application was dismissed and the matter is now before the Court of Appeal, he said.

""You need to know adab (respect), akhlaq (ethics) and... good values,"" he added.

He said understanding the importance of knowledge will help students effect change in society, not only within the country but also in the international community.

Assistant Professor Srirat Lapyai pointed out that Prathom (primary school) children have access to these e-cigarettes, which entered the Thailand market for the first time in mid-2024.

This led parents to ask media outlets to write about the matter, she said.

She noted that these disposable e-cigarettes are produced in the shape of popular cartoon characters, toys, candy boxes, juice or milk boxes, collectable figures, key chains and stationery.

They also come in various colours and flavours such as strawberry, mango, peach and blueberry.

“Making cartoon-shaped e-cigarettes is a strategy called harm reduction, aiming to reduce the harm of cigarettes with a cute appearance,” she said.

Prof Srirat emphasised that nicotine from toy pods can affect children’s health similar to general e-cigarettes, though smoking them causes less irritation to the throat.

Toy pods are being sold at 99 baht (US$2.92) each, making them accessible to children, she said, adding that these items are currently available for sale near schools and on online channels.

1565686,Assistance dogs help to calm nervous travellers in the airport,"Nervous fliers and stressed passengers have a furry respite at North Macedonia’s main airport, thanks to Dino the Golden Retriever’s presence in the departure lounge.

Better known by his nickname “zen dog”, the four-year-old pup makes regular stops at Skopje’s airport to “provide a more relaxing and pleasant travel experience”, according to the facility’s management.

“We are aware that travelling can be stressful,” said Maja Bajalska Georgievska, communications manager of the capital’s airport.

To help calm the anxious, Dino makes multiple passes by the airport’s boarding gates, allowing passengers to pat the curious canine and enjoy a moment of zen or snap a selfie.

“Even when he’s not approached by travellers, he tries to interact with them,” said Dino’s trainer Vesna Kiskovska.

“He’s a Golden Retriever, a dog who loves making friends.”

The programme is the first of its kind in the region, according to TAV Airports Holding, the operator of Skopje’s airport.

Aerophobia – or a fear of flying – is common among travellers, according to various studies.

Dogs, however, seem to possess a unique ability to help curb stress in humans.

According to a 2021 study published in the Journal Of Clinical Medicine, “Assistance dogs can make patients with anxiety disorders feel safer; they facilitate social activity and reduce the feelings of isolation and loneliness”.

Since last November, Dino has visited Skopje’s airport dozens of times, usually during busier periods, to help calm travellers.

1566803,New Australian blood test capable of detecting pregnancy health complications earlier,"SYDNEY: Australian scientists have developed a new blood test capable of detecting health complications early in pregnancy.

The research team from the University of Queensland (UQ) said in a study published on Thursday (Feb 27) that their ""nanoflower sensor"" could help reduce hospital admissions for newborn babies.

The test screens blood samples for cell biomarkers and can detect complications such as gestational diabetes, preterm birth risks and high blood pressure as early as 11 weeks into a pregnancy.

Carlos Salomon Gallo from UQ's Centre for Clinical Research said that the team tested the sensor on blood samples from 201 pregnant women at 11-13 weeks gestation and detected possible complications.

""Currently, most pregnancy complications can not be identified until the second or third trimester, which means it can sometimes be too late for effective intervention,"" he said in a media release.

""However, with this technology, pregnant women will be able to seek medical intervention much earlier. We also found our biosensor has more than 90 per cent accuracy in identifying women at risk of developing pregnancy complications.""

He said that the technology could save the healthcare system millions of dollars every year by reducing neonatal intensive care unit admissions and preventing emergency pregnancy interventions, including cesarean section.

""This has the potential to revolutionise earlier risk assessment and interventions, improving clinical decision-making in obstetric care,"" Salomon Gallo said.

Mostafa Kamal Masud, a co-author of the study from UQ's Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, said that the technology used nanosensors to detect low concentrations of biomarkers indicating possible health complications that are missed by current less sensitive testing methods. - Xinhua",AseanPlus,AseanPlus News,Complimentary,Short,,2025-02-27,"Australia,blood test,pregnancy complications,detection",SYDNEY: Australian scientists have developed a new blood test capable of detecting health complications early in pregnancy.,https://www.thestar.com.my/aseanplus/aseanplus-news/2025/02/27/new-australian-blood-test-capable-of-detecting-pregnancy-health-complications-earlier,https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/02/27/3188234.jpg,269

The park is 0.24sq m, equivalent to two sheets of A3 paper, according to Guinness. The park was originally a small space that became not useful as a result of land readjustment work by the town.

A small bench was later installed as a resting space for residents in 1988, but it had not been registered as a park.

Because the small space, which the town unofficially claimed “world’s smallest park”, drew attention on social media in recent years, the town decided to register it as a park and applied to Guinness World Records for formal recognition.

She added the decline from 2022’s tax collection which recorded RM40.385bil, was due to reduced tax assessment and tax write-offs.

“Among the reasons behind the reduction was due to appeals by taxpayers (56.2%), court decisions (8.2%) and tax exemptions (35.6%) under Section 127 (3A) of the Income Tax Act 1967,” she said in a statement on Thursday (Feb 27).

Meanwhile, Mas Ermieyati said a loophole that allows LHDN officers to approve tax reductions without a clear limit is causing potential leakages in tax collections.

“The PAC found that the powers to approve tax reductions have been delegated to officers at various levels, including branches or states.

“No fixed limit is given on the tax reductions and this is seen as a loophole that could open the doors to possible leakages,” she added.

In efforts to strengthen the collections process, she said the LHDN has implemented an internal tracking system called ReMS2.0 to detect non-compliance.

1566972,Rare planetary alignment visible this week: Thai astronomers,"BANGKOK: A parade when planets in the Solar System align in the evening sky can be observed this week, according to the National Astronomical Research Institute of Thailand (Narit).

Except for the Moon, stargazers can observe Saturn, Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, and Mars with the naked eye until Feb 28. A telescope is recommended to observe Uranus and Neptune.

“This is a great opportunity to see multiple planets at once,” Narit said.

The institute explained that planetary alignments occur when planets reach positions in their orbits that make them appear in the same region of the sky from Earth's perspective.

However, this alignment does not mean the planets are physically in a straight line when viewed from space.

What makes the phenomenon special is that all planets will appear in the sky in the early evening, the institute said, adding that this phenomenon occurs rarely.

Stargazers who miss this week’s alignment can observe the phenomenon again on March 1-5, when all planets will be visible. Another chance will occur from March 6-15, though Saturn will not be observable during this period.

Narit also invites people to participate in stargazing activities every Saturday at Princess Sirindhorn AstroPark in Mae Rim, Chiang Mai, as well as at Regional Observatories for the Public in Nakhon Ratchasima, Khon Kaen, Chachoengsao, and Songkhla.

When ordered to stop, the driver rammed through a roadblock and sped off, prompting police to give chase.

""It came to a stop when one of its tyres punctured, but the two male suspects fled into a nearby village. A search of the vehicle uncovered 200 packages of meth weighing 200kg and a mobile phone,"" he said during a special press conference at the Kelantan Police Contingent Headquarters today.

Mohd Yusoff said the vehicle was registered to a 39-year-old man from Tumpat, believed to be one of the men who had fled.

""An examination of the abandoned mobile phone revealed that one of the suspects, known as Faizal, had managed to send a message to his wife, telling her to flee as police were closing in on him.

""We have recorded his wife's statement and are actively tracking down the main suspect from Kampung Bendang Pok Yong and his accomplice, who is in his 30s,"" he said.

Mohd Yusoff added that the methamphetamine was believed to have been sourced from a neighbouring country and could supply up to two million users.

""The case is being investigated under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952.

He also clarified that Sarawak previously never allowed the importation of live pigs and pork from the peninsula as it was not FMD-free.

In a statement, Rubio said the expanded restrictions target individuals and immediate family members of individuals believed to be responsible for the program, which he described as ""forced labor."" The U.S. has already imposed restrictions on several people, including some Venezuelans, he added.

The Caribbean island nation's health service generates major export earnings by sending health workers around the world.

""Cuba's labor export programs, which include the medical missions, enrich the Cuban regime, and in the case of Cuba's overseas medical missions, deprive ordinary Cubans of the medical care they desperately need in their home country,"" Rubio said.

The Cuban government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The United States and Cuba have had a strained relationship since Fidel Castro took over in a 1959 revolution, and a U.S. trade embargo has been in place for decades.

The survey found that Americans' attitudes toward Trump were essentially unchanged as he fired tens of thousands of federal workers and upended the U.S. approach to the Ukraine-Russia war.

The poll found 50% disapproved of the job he was doing, down from 51% last week, a change well within the poll's margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

Public approval of Trump's job performance so far has remained higher than it was for most of his 2017-2021 first term in office and higher than his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, enjoyed during his four-year term.

The poll of 1,029 U.S. adults, conducted online Friday through Sunday, also found that 50% of respondentssupported Trump's approach on immigration, up from 47% last week. Another 42% said they did not support his immigration policy.

Americans' views on other top issues were relatively unchanged. Some 41% said they approved of Trump's management of the economy and 34% said they approved of the way he was handling the cost of living.

Some 38% of poll respondents said they had a favorable view of Elon Musk, the tech billionaire who is serving as the point person for Trump's effort to overhaul the government, while 57% said they viewed him unfavorably.

“The Trump administration will enforce all our immigration laws — we will not pick and choose which laws we will enforce,"" a department spokesperson said. ""We must know who is in our country for the safety and security of our homeland and all Americans.”

All immigrants over the age of 14 who were not fingerprinted or registered when applying for a U.S. visa and who remain in the United States for 30 days or longer are required to register and be fingerprinted, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website where immigrants can register.

Once an immigrant has registered and been fingerprinted, the Department of Homeland Security will issue evidence of registration, which must be carried by immigrants over the age of 18 at all times, according to the website.

On his return to office last month, President Donald Trump declared illegal immigration at the Mexico border a national emergency and directed the department to ensure that immigrants register with the federal government.

The administration has sought to shut down the previous Biden administration's CBP One entry program, which had allowed hundreds of thousands of migrants to enter the U.S. legally by scheduling an appointment on an app.

1566333,Putin hosts Guinea-Bissau leader as Russia builds Africa ties,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin hosted Guinea-Bissau President Umaro Sissoco Embalo for talks in the Kremlin on Wednesday, the latest sign of a drive by Moscow to build up economic and security relationships with countries in west and central Africa.

State TV showed Russian metals tycoon Oleg Deripaska was present at the talks between the two leaders. Russian and Portuguese news outlets have quoted a Guinea-Bissau minister as saying Russian aluminium company Rusal is interested in building a railway and port in the country and exploring for bauxite.

Embalo took office in 2020 and his term expires this year, although there is a dispute with the opposition over the timing of the next election. The opposition has vowed to bring the country to a standstill on Thursday in the row which centres on when Embalo's mandate runs out.

Embalo has said there have been two attempts to overthrow him, the most recent in December 2023. After that incident, which involved gunfire and clashes in the capital, he dissolved the opposition-controlled parliament, accusing it of passivity.

Russia has built security ties in recent years with a series of African countries, sending thousands of mercenaries to support military leaders and help them fight insurgents. It was not clear if any such deals were on the agenda for Wednesday's meeting.

For Moscow, the assignments are a way to make money from government fees and economic opportunities in mining or energy, while eroding the influence in the region of former colonial powers, particularly France. Guinea-Bissau is a former Portuguese colony that gained independence in 1974.

During a red-carpet interview at the 2025 NAACP Image Awards, Wayans said that it’s about time White Chicks had a sequel as fans continually asked for it, two decades after the first film’s release.

“Every single day, [they asked] ‘When are you doing the sequel?,’ They love that movie. You know, I think it’s time. So, you know, let’s get Scary Movie 6 done, and then we’re gonna go bring out the White Chicks 2.” he told Good Morning America.

After the interview made headlines, Wayans took to Instagram to share an art card of his seeming confirmation of a possible White Chicks 2.

“Not TRUE. But maybe ONE DAY,” he wrote in his caption, with fans speculating that the capitalised words read “true one day.”

Marlon starred in White Chicks alongside his brother Shawn where they played two black male FBI agents who go undercover as white women, who were hotel heiresses, to protect them from a kidnapping.

The buddy cop crime comedy also stars Jaime King, Brittany Daniel, Lochlyn Munro, Busy Philipps, Jessica Cauffiel, Jennifer Carpenter and Terry Crews, among others.

""I’ve had conversations with him at this point,” Khosrowshahi said Friday in an interview with Bloomberg TV’s Manus Cranny at the FII conference in Miami. ""They want to build it alone, so to some extent in Austin, we and Waymo will be competing with Tesla when they launch,” he said, referring to Alphabet Inc’s autonomous-vehicle unit. ""Life is long, but we would love to partner with them.”

Khosrowshahi added that it would make ""a lot of economic sense” for Uber to be a platform for Tesla drivers. ""What we bring is demand to the AV ecosystem when demand often is quite variable.”

A Tesla spokesperson did not respond to an emailed request for comment.

Uber executives have dedicated more time in their earnings calls and other presentations to elaborate on the company’s AV strategy. Since 2023, it’s struck more than a dozen manufacturer partnerships and has invested in multiple self-driving technology companies.

Some Wall Street investors have been nervous about the future of Uber and rideshare peer Lyft Inc’s business model, which currently relies on a large population of human drivers that are quickly matched with riders.

The launch of Tesla robotaxis and the broader rollout of Waymo rides could hurt Uber’s ride volume growth and lower the commission rate it can make, Bloomberg Intelligence has said.

While Uber will launch autonomous rides with Waymo in Austin next month and in Atlanta over the summer, Waymo also offers driverless rides through its own consumer app in other key markets, including San Francisco and, starting next year, Miami. – Bloomberg",Tech,Driverless vehicle,Complimentary,Short,,2025-02-26,"Driverless vehicle,e-Hailing,Technology","Uber Technologies Inc chief executive officer Dara Khosrowshahi said Elon Musk was not open to making Tesla Inc's planned robotaxis available on the ride-sharing platform, making Uber a future competitor.",https://www.thestar.com.my/tech/tech-news/2025/02/26/uber-ceo-says-elon-musk-wants-to-go-alone-on-tesla-robotaxi-rollout,https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/02/26/3186483.JPG,289

Home Affairs and Law Minister K Shanmugam and Manpower Minister Tan See Leng had threatened legal action in December, saying at the time a Bloomberg report on Singapore real estate that mentioned them by name was libellous.

Bloomberg declined to comment on the lawsuits on Wednesday. The lawsuits will be heard at the Supreme Court on March 3.

Singapore's government ordered Bloomberg in December to issue a ""correction direction"" on the report, under the country's Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act.

The media company complied and updated the original story with a notice saying the correction direction had been published ""under threat of sanction"" and it stood by its reporting.

Senior figures in the ruling People's Action Party, including former Prime Ministers Lee Kuan Yew and Lee Hsien Loong, have filed successful defamation lawsuits against media and political opponents.

Shanmugam and Tan are represented by lawyer Davinder Singh, a former ruling party parliamentarian who has represented former premiers in defamation suits.

Singh did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.

The tech billionaire was born to an affluent South African family in Pretoria before immigrating to Canada and acquiring Canadian citizenship via his mother Maye Musk, who is originally from the province of Saskatchewan.

The petition that opened for signatures on Feb 20 says Musk ""has engaged in activities that go against the national interest of Canada"".

It also says Musk, who is also a US citizen and a top advisor to US President Donald Trump, has become ""a member of a foreign government that is attempting to erase Canadian sovereignty.""

In a now-deleted post Monday, Musk mocked the petition, claiming ""Canada is not a real country,"" he wrote on the social media platform X he owns.

He has strongly supported Trump who has repeatedly questioned Canadian sovereignty, ridiculed Canada's political leaders and argued that Canada should become a US state.

Canadian federal lawmaker Charlie Angus, who sponsored the petition, said the effort ""gives an opportunity for people to express their justifiable anger at the growing power of oligarchs and extremists"".

""People like Elon Musk are enemies of our country,"" added Angus, a member of the leftist New Democratic Party.

Petitions presented to Canada's parliament cannot mandate action but may receive an official response from the government.

Parliament is currently suspended and is not due to resume until March 24.

1565909,North Korea's Kim calls for building modern army to brace for war,"SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for building a strong, modern army to cope with any war during a visit to a military academy, state media KCNA said on Wednesday.

Kim's trip to the Kang Kon Military Academy comes after North Korea has sent thousands of troops to Russia to support its war against Ukraine. This week Kim also visited the Kim Il Sung University of Politics, another elite cadre training institution, calling for military loyalty and sacrifice.

South Korea's intelligence agency has said Kim's previous inspections of military units and training might be part of preparations for an additional dispatch of soldiers to Russia.

During the latest visit to the military academy, Kim criticised the school's poor management and operation of educational facilities, saying it failed to meet the ruling party's pursuit of ""modernity and advanced character"" in building a powerful army, KCNA said.

He laid out tasks to refurbish the facilities and intensify education focusing on practice so that the students would learn about the ""actual experiences of modern warfare"", and to master advanced weapons and technical equipment, it said.

""The present international situation, in which the aggressive and bellicose nature of the imperialists is most openly expressed in history and war and bloodshed become commonplaces, requires the armed forces ... to perfectly cope with a war,"" Kim said, according to KCNA. South Korean officials have warned that North Korea could benefit from supplying weapons and troops to fight in Russia by gaining experience and insight from operating on a modern battlefield.

Kyiv has said North Korean forces have suffered heavy casualties in Russia, with more than 3,000 soldiers killed or wounded by early January this year.

Shares of the California-based company rose 6.7% in extended trading.

Cooling inflation and a stable job market are encouraging businesses to hire, boosting demand for workforce management solutions such as those offered by Workday.

The company's incorporation of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and machine learning into its product offerings has further improved investor confidence.

""Our fourth quarter results were driven by solid performance across key growth areas of the business, including continued momentum with our full suite and financials products, growing demand for our AI SKUs, and strong execution across industry verticals,"" said CFO Zane Rowe.

The company recently launched the Workday Agent System of Record to help organizations manage all their AI agents, from Workday and third-party sources alike.

Earlier in February, Workday said it would cut around 1,750 jobs, or 8.5% of its current workforce, as the human capital management firm invests heavily in artificial intelligence to counter a softer macroeconomic environment.

Total revenue for the fourth quarter ended January 31 came in at $2.21 billion, beating analysts' estimates of $2.18 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.

The company reported subscription revenue of $2.04 billion, while analysts were expecting $2.03 billion.

Workday forecast subscription revenue for the first quarter to be $2.05 billion, compared with expectations of $2.06 billion.

The mobile launch adds to Adobe’s Photoshop app for Apple Inc’s iPad and the company plans a release for Alphabet Inc’s Android later in the year, it said on Feb 25. Many of Photoshop’s core features are available in the free version, including generative AI that can fill gaps in an image or editing photos in layers, and there’s a US$7.99 (RM35) subscription that adds premium features.

San Jose-based Adobe has long been a leader in design and creative software on the desktop. However, it hasn’t found great success in translating that strength over to mobile platforms.

1565989,Boxing-Eubank Jr slaps Benn with egg in press conference,"(Reuters) - Chris Eubank Jr smashed an egg into Conor Benn's face at a press conference in Manchester on Tuesday, two months before their showdown at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.

A much-hyped fight between the sons of two former British arch-rivals was called off in 2022 when Benn returned a finding for trace amounts of fertility drug clomifene.

The pair are now due to meet on April 28 in the rearranged bout.

""Apparently egg contamination was the reason for his two failed drugs tests. So I contaminated him with an egg,"" Eubank Jr posted on social media platform X.

Benn, the son of former super-middleweight world champion Nigel Benn, was cleared of intentional doping in 2023 by the World Boxing Council, which said a ""highly elevated consumption of eggs"" was a reasonable explanation for the failed tests.

A provisional suspension was then reimposed after successful appeals by UK anti-doping (UKAD) and the British Boxing Board of Control before UKAD confirmed late last year it had received the National Anti-Doping Panel's decision and that the 28-year-old's provisional suspension had been lifted.

""That's the only shot you'll land on me ... two rounds you are finished,"" Benn posted on X.

Suaalii, who made his test debut in the Wallabies' season-ending tour of Europe, missed training last week as the Waratahs had a bye in the second round.

Coach Dan McKellar downplayed his absence, saying: ""Sometimes you've got to put the Ferraris in the garage.""

But McKellar acknowledged on Wednesday that the 21-year-old fullback had been nursing a toe problem.

""We haven't got all the details yet, but hopefully that's short term,"" he told reporters.

""He pulled up sore (after round one) but recovered quite well and we thought he would be right for this week, but unfortunately he is not.""

Suaalii was a winner in his Super Rugby Pacific debut as the Waratahs clinched a last-gasp 37-36 victory over the Otago Highlanders in round one.

The Waratahs face a Drua side who are winless from two games this season.

The Proteas were unsure if Klaasen would have been available to face Australia in their second match in Rawalpindi on Tuesday but the game was abandoned without a ball being bowled due to rain.

""Everyone is good. Klaasen has recovered from the fitness (issue). That adds a lot of value and the team spirit is good,"" Bavuma told reporters.

Bavuma said his team will rest for a couple of days before turning their attention to England, who meet Afghanistan later on Wednesday. The loser of that match will be out of contention for the semi-finals.

South Africa top their group on net run rate ahead of Australia, with both teams on three points. Another victory will send the South Africans through to the last four.

The practice of fans being allowed to walk along the track post-race and get up close to drivers on the podium was banned last year following a crowd invasion in 2023.

Organisers said the ""track walk"" was back, though, following approval from authorities.

""The track walk is a unique and cherished experience for our fans, and we are very excited to be able to welcome it back for 2025 and have this incredible moment shared around the world,"" Australian Grand Prix Corporation boss Travis Auld said on Wednesday.

1566092,Soccer-Chung elected to lead South Korean FA for fourth term,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean businessman Chung Mong-gyu was elected to head the country's football governing body for a fourth term on Wednesday after he withstood a scandal over the appointment of national team coaches last year that sparked calls for him to step down.

Chung won in the first round of the election to lead the Korea Football Association (KFA) for the next four years.

Speaking to the press after being reelected, Chung thanked those who voted for him and said he felt a ""bigger responsibility"" and vowed to keep his promises.

""I hope the weather will be warmer and spring will come in football too,"" he said.

In November, Chung, who has led the KFA since 2013, faced calls from the sports ministry to be suspended for breaking its own rules when hiring two men's national team head coaches.

The recommendation was included in the final results of an audit probing the organisation's recruitment of Hong Myung-bo and his predecessor Jurgen Klinsmann, which sparked a public backlash amid accusations of favouritism.

Hong had said his appointment was not the result of preferential treatment from the KFA.

A court earlier this month granted a request by the KFA to halt the execution of the ministry's demand to penalise its chief, allowing him to run for reelection, according to the Yonhap News Agency.

When asked about improving relations with the government, Chung said he would explain his position at a later date.

The businessman has previously pledged to donate 5 billion won ($3.49 million) to build a new football centre.

1565491,Griffin pays US$45mil for Park Avenue building,"NEW YORK: Billionaire Ken Griffin has added another luxury home to his collection, buying an apartment in one of Manhattan’s most exclusive co-op buildings.

The Citadel founder paid US$45mil for a duplex at 740 Park Ave that had been owned by Julia Koch, the widow of billionaire businessman David Koch, according to people familiar with the matter.

The Rosario Candela-designed building, completed around 1930, is about a mile north from Citadel’s offices in the ultra-modern 425 Park Ave and the proposed skyscraper at 350 Park, where Citadel and Citadel Securities will be anchor tenants.

Griffin already owns other homes in Manhattan, including a penthouse condo he bought for a record-setting US$238mil in 2019 at 220 Central Park South, along Billionaires’ Row.

His new apartment unit spans 8,500 square feet on the fourth and fifth floors of 740 Park Ave., which is already the New York home of Stephen Schwarzman, Blackstone Inc’s chairman and chief executive officer, and other titans from the world of finance.

Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis lived there as a child and John D. Rockefeller owned the unit that is now Schwarzman’s.

The sale was completed last week, and the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that Griffin was the buyer.

“Koch looked to sell the 18-room co-op after her husband’s 2019 death and had asked as much as US$60mil when quietly marketing it in 2022,” the Journal reported at the time.

It was listed for US$48mil in 2023. David Koch had bought it for US$17mil in 2004.

1565496,NexG poised for growth with tech expansion,"PETALING JAYA: The outlook for NexG Bhd, formerly known as Datasonic Group Bhd , remains strong following its RM9.97mil contract win from the Civil Aviation Authority of Malaysia (CAAM).

The contract, awarded to NexG’s wholly-owned subsidiary NexG Technologies Sdn Bhd, for the development of an unmanned aircraft system traffic management system, reinforced the group’s strategic push into technology and security solutions, setting the stage for future growth opportunities.

BIMB Research viewed the contract win positively, noting that it aligns with NexG’s strategic goal of diversifying into new business segments.

However, BIMB Research noted that the contract’s relatively modest value might not significantly impact NexG’s near-term earnings.

“Though we remain upbeat on NexG’s growth prospects, we do not foresee a material impact on earnings in the near term, given the relatively modest contract value,” the research house stated in its report yesterday.

BIMB Research maintained its “buy” recommendation on NexG with an unchanged target price of 45 sen, based on a price-to-earnings ratio of 18 times, applied to the forecast earnings per share of 2.5 sen for the financial year ending March 31, 2026.

It noted that NexG warranted a premium valuation due to its market leadership in secure identification solutions, a solid order book of RM400mil, promising prospects for overseas expansion and ongoing diversification initiatives.

The project, set to be executed in phases (U1 and U2) over 24 months from March 5, 2025 to March 4, 2027, aims to improve air traffic management for drones and unmanned aerial vehicles in both controlled and uncontrolled airspace.

Antony, who joined Betis on loan for the rest of the season from Manchester United in January, was sent off in added time in his side's 2-1 win on Sunday, shown a straight red card after a late tackle on Juan Iglesias.

Betis appealed on the grounds that the referee's report did not reflect what happened, and the RFEF Disciplinary Committee agreed that Antony's intention was to play the ball without making contact with his opponent.

Real Betis, seventh in the LaLiga standings, host Real Madrid on Sunday. Champions Real, second and level on points with leaders Barcelona, will be without English midfielder Jude Bellingham who is serving a two-match suspension.

Kuhnemann was reported by match officials for a suspected illegal bowling action after he took 16 wickets in Australia's 2-0 test series win over Sri Lanka this month and he underwent an assessment at the National Cricket Centre in Brisbane.

A bowler is allowed 15 degrees of extension in their elbow before a delivery is considered illegal.

The International Cricket Council added on Wednesday the amount of elbow extension for all of Kuhnemann's deliveries was found to be within the level of tolerance permitted under the ICC Illegal Bowling Regulations.

Kuhnemann's case had generated debate in Australia because of the 28-year-old's previously spotless record in more than 100 professional matches dating back to 2017, including five tests and four one-day internationals.

Bukit Assek assemblyman Joseph Chieng said this would ensure life-saving interventions are both accessible and effective when needed.

Chieng said this in response to Deputy Premier Datuk Dr Sim Kui Hian’s proposal to amend Sarawak Building Ordinance 1994, making AEDs mandatory in some locations.

“Given Sarawak’s high prevalence of heart disease, I fully support this proposal and believe MRCS Sibu can play a crucial role in its implementation,” Chieng said during the society’s appreciation dinner.

He added that it was not enough just to have AEDs and regulations.

“If no one knows how to use the equipment, its presence cannot save lives.

“This is why Sibu branch must take the lead in providing AED training to local communities.”

Separately, Chieng said the branch faced challenges in recruiting members and volunteers.

He said sustaining financial stability was also a pressing issue as the organisation depended on public support and sponsorships to continue its work.

“Raising awareness about the importance of humanitarian efforts requires consistent engagement and education of the community,” he added.

Chieng commended members, volunteers and staff of the Sibu branch for their dedication and tireless service.

“From disaster response and health campaigns to first-aid training and humanitarian outreach, your contributions reflect the core values of the Red Crescent movement: humanity, impartiality and voluntary service.

The TV chef and restaurateur, 58, known for his Hell's Kitchen and Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares reality TV programmes, recently launched Lucky Cat 22 Bishopsgate by Gordon Ramsay - which features the beckoning Japanese cat models called maneki-neko.

He told ITV's The Jonathan Ross Show he had issues with couples entering the toilets together, and also revealed he had a lot of thefts.

He said: ""The cats are getting stolen. There were 477 stolen last week - they cost £4.50 each.""

1564087,Turkish authorities shut down historical structure illegally turned into a luxury spa,"Turkish authorities have sealed off a luxury spa run by a five-star Istanbul hotel that was set up by illegally modifying a 1,500-year-old cistern, officials said recently.

The Navitas Spa Sarnic is operated by the Hagia Sofia Mansions Istanbul hotel, which is part of Hilton’s luxury Curio Collection that currently offers top-price suites.

The hotel, just a short walk from the Hagia Sofia, a Unesco World Heritage site, modified the ancient structure to include a jacuzzi-style swimming pool, sauna and massage rooms and a Turkish hammam.

The revelations about the work sparked an online backlash on social media and eventually local officials took action.

“The swimming and spa centre near the Hagia Sophia mosque ... was sealed off by teams from the Fatih municipality in line with a decision by its preservation committee,” a municipal official said.

The culture and tourism ministry also said it had lodged a complaint in 2023 about “unauthorised practices” concerning the spa.

The hotel is in the Sultanahmet neighbourhood, known for the Grand Bazaar, the Blue Mosque with its iconic minarets and the Hagia Sophia.

“Our spa offers a Turkish Bath and a restored 1,500-year-old cistern,” the hotel website says, showing photos of a tastefully-lit brick-lined underground pool with bubbling turquoise waters.

The municipality said the cistern was owned by Dorak, a holding company with tourism assets across Turkiye.

Contacted by AFP, a Dorak spokeswoman said she was unable to comment as “a legal process was ongoing”.

Alibaba's announcement follows similar action from startup DeepSeek whose ostensibly low-cost open-source models earlier this year generated excitement among technology investors and surprise in the capital-intensive sector with performance akin to those of more established rivals such as OpenAI.

Alibaba said it has released four variants of Wan 2.1 - T2V-1.3B, T2V-14B, I2V-14B-720P and I2V-14B-480P - which generate images and videos from text and image input. The ""14B"" indicates the variant accepts 14 billion parameters, meaning it can process far more input to yield more accurate results.

The models are available globally on Alibaba Cloud's ModelScope and HuggingFace platforms for academic, research and commercial.

Alibaba introduced the latest version of its video- and image-generating AI model in January - later shortening its name to Wan from Wanx - touting its ability to generate highly realistic visuals.

The firm has since highlighted its top ranking on VBench, a leaderboard for video generative models, where it leads in functionality such as multi-object interaction.

On Tuesday, Alibaba released a preview of reasoning model QwQ-Max which it plans to make open source upon full release.

It also announced plans this week to invest at least 380 billion yuan ($52 billion) over the next three years to bolster cloud computing and AI infrastructure.

1565156,Taiwanese actor Lee Wei reclassified as a suspect in group murder case,"Taiwanese actor Lee Wei has been named a suspect in the group murder of a woman at a Bhuddist group's meeting place in Taipei's Da'an District.

The 44-year-old had been summoned by authorities three times as a witness in January.

On Monday (Feb 24), Lee and his wife, surnamed Chien, was released on NT$300,000 (RM40,437) and NT$150,000 (RM20,218) bail, respectively. Both had been summoned by prosecutors to provide statements.

In July 2024, a female accountant, surnamed Cai, was found dead after joining religious writer Wang Yun in Taipei to practise spiritual cultivation.

An autopsy conducted later determined that she had died from rhabdomyolysis – a condition involving the rapid breakdown of muscles, often caused by traumatic injury.

Surveillance footage revealed several individuals loading Cai's body into a cart and transporting it from a tea house to a monastery. Investigators also discovered that Cai's bank account had been emptied.

Lee, who rose to fame for his role in the 2001 drama Toast Boy's Kiss, has stayed out of the spotlight in recent years.

The actor was reclassified as a suspect after authorities obtained an audio recording in which he allegedly instructed those involved on how to respond to the investigation. He's also accused of helping them coordinate testimonies to withhold information.

Selangor local government and tourism committee chairman Datuk Ng Suee Lim said that MPS was expected to see an additional RM26mil in revenue due to this year's assessment tax revision.

As a result, he said MPS has outlined short, medium, and long-term plans to enhance its services.

“Other immediate efforts include better management of stray dogs.

“A total of 147 neighbourhood signages will also be replaced in phases over the next two years.

“Furthermore, 46 new business activities will be added to the list of 23 activities that can receive immediate licences.

“The installation of 50 closed-circuit television cameras will also take place at crime and illegal dumping hotspots,” he said in response to questions from Chua Wei Kiat (PH-Rawang) on MPS' plans to utilise the increased revenue, during the Selangor State Assembly sitting at Bangunan Dewan Negeri Selangor in Shah Alam.

Regarding the medium-term plan, Ng said MPS planned to upgrade all its sports facilities, with at least one being upgraded per year.

“A centralised recycling centre in Rawang Perdana is in the pipeline, with a focus on recycling organic waste from selected food premises and markets, used cooking oil, and garden waste by MPS-appointed contractors.

“Additionally, there is a proposal to instal signage with QR codes at 256 slopes to provide information on the slopes and related works,” he added.

Klang Royal City Council (MBDK) mayor Datuk Abd Hamid Hussain said this during a ceremony to mark its declaration as a township at Senior’s Friendly Park on Jalan Dato Abdul Hamid 25.

Abd Hamid said Bandar Sentosa, which is sandwiched between Jalan Sungai Jati and Jalan Kebun Nenas and bordered by Lorong Dato Dagang 52/KS7 and Jalan Raja Nong, had a Sentosa Township Action Plan to serve a 890ha area with a population of about 93,000.

“Bandar Sentosa has gone through piecemeal development, and public facilities were not provided in a comprehensive manner.

“This action plan has taken into account the current needs of Bandar Sentosa,” he added.

Abd Hamid said based on MBDK’s Local Plan 2035 (Amendment 1), the largest land use in Bandar Sentosa is residential, followed by industrial and commercial zones.

“Bandar Sentosa is well connected with good transportation networks via Jalan Kebun, Jalan Sungai Jati, Jalan Raja Nong, Jalan Kebun Nenas and Persiaran Puteri as well as Shah Alam Expressway (Kesas) and West Coast Expressway,” he said.

Abd Hamid added that Bandar Sentosa was close to key growth centres such as Ambang Botanik, Bandar Puteri, Bandar Putera, Bandar Bukit Tinggi 1 and 2, Bandar Botanik, Kota Bayuemas, Bandar Parkland and Bandar Bestari.

The change in status was mooted by Sentosa assemblyman G. Gunaraj, who in his speech called on Abd Hamid to help alleviate flooding in the township.

Veeam's software is designed to help customers quickly recover their data after cybersecurity incidents, ransomware attacks or accidental data loss.

Its core product supports immutable backups to prevent ransomware from modifying or deleting data, ensuring that clean copies remain available for recovery even if hackers encrypt files.

Microsoft had invested in cybersecurity firm Rubrik in 2021, which also offers data backup and recovery solutions.

Veeam said it would focus on research and development investments and design collaboration, among others, with the support of Microsoft. It will also integrate Microsoft's AI services into its products.

U.S. private equity firm Insight Partners, which is the largest shareholder in Veeam, sold a $2 billion stake in the company in a secondary sale valuing the firm at $15 billion, it said in December last year.

Veeam was acquired by Insight Partners for about $5 billion in 2020.

Founded in 2006, Veeam has more than 550,000 customers globally including corporations such as Deloitte and Canon, according to its website.

Liverpool are on 64 points from 27 matches, with second-placed Arsenal, who have played a game less, on 53 points after Saturday's 1-0 home loss to West Ham United.

Slot expects another tough game on Wednesday against fifth-placed Newcastle United, who drew with Liverpool in December and are coming off a 4-3 win over Nottingham Forest.

1564977,Cricket-Root backs Buttler's captaincy despite England setbacks,"(Reuters) - Joe Root has thrown his support behind white-ball captain Jos Buttler despite England's shaky start to the Champions Trophy, describing him as a ""brilliant leader"" who has the support of the entire dressing room.

England lost their opening game to Australia by five wickets on Saturday after setting the 50-overs world champions a target of 352 but former test skipper Root said Buttler was doing everything a good captain should.

""He's doing so much right on the field, making good decisions and creating a really good environment for us to thrive in,"" Root, who scored 68 against Australia in Lahore, told British media on Monday.

""He's a brilliant leader. He's the best white-ball player we've ever produced and he's got the full support of everyone within our dressing room to keep doing and keep bringing everything that he's brought so far to this team.""

Wicketkeeper Buttler assumed the captaincy after Eoin Morgan retired in June 2022 and led England to their second 20-overs World Cup title later that year.

England's performances have dipped since then, however, with the side failing to defend their T20 and 50-overs World Cup titles.

They also face an early exit from the Champions Trophy unless they quickly turn things around, starting with their game against Afghanistan on Wednesday.

The former world number two, who turns 35 next month, gave birth to her son Petr last July and will return to the WTA Tour in Austin, Texas before high-profile hardcourt events in Indian Wells and Miami.

New mothers Elina Svitolina and Naomi Osaka have both returned to a high level after time away from the game while Belinda Bencic won the Abu Dhabi title this month.

""Those girls are pretty young still of course, I would say my age is different,"" Kvitova told the WTA website.

""But we're used to working hard. Even after pregnancy and giving birth we know what to do and we're willing to do it. When you already played well before, you want to be back where you belong, basically.

""Belinda and I are in touch, and it's nice she's playing so well. Her daughter is like 2-1/2 months older than our Petr, so that's fun. She just showed us that it's possible, coming back after giving birth. That's a good sign.""

Kvitova meets Briton Jodie Burrage later on Tuesday in her first match in 17 months and she said it felt like a big deal.

""Sometimes I'm really surprised by myself. Like, why I did it? I would have regretted it if I didn't come back,"" she said.

""I'm not putting any goals on myself, I'll never play as good as I was playing when I was winning tournaments.

1565158,Rugby-Double World Cup winner Kitshoff forced to retire after neck injury,"CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - Double World Cup winning prop forward Steven Kitshoff has been forced to retire from rugby after a serious neck injury, his club Stormers announced on Tuesday.

The 33-year-old, who played in South Africa’s World Cup winning teams in Japan in 2019 and France in 2023 and earned 138 caps for the Springboks, sustained the neck injury playing in a Currie Cup match for Western Province last year.

“After undergoing initial conservative therapy, the decision was taken to have stabilising surgery. Following an extensive rehabilitation process he has been left with significantly reduced rotation of his neck and the advice from a specialist neurosurgeon was that there would be a high risk of another injury should he continue playing,” the club said a statement.

Kitshoff was first called into the Stormers squad as an 18-year-old, requiring special permission to train with the seniors at such a young age, debuting in 2011 and winning a first Springbok cap in 2016.

His distinctive red hair made him a standout on the pitch.

“It is obviously incredibly disappointing for my career to end in this way, but unfortunately the risk to my wellbeing was simply too high,” he said.

1564949,"Taiwan economy ministry has received no information about any TSMC investment in Intel, US","TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's economy minister said on Tuesday his ministry had not received information about an overseas investment application by Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC, when asked about possible investment in Intel and the United States.

U.S. media has reported that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the world's largest contract chipmaker and a major supplier to companies including Apple and Nvidia, has been in talks to potentially take a stake in Intel.

Neither TSMC nor Intel has confirmed the reports.

Any large overseas investment by a Taiwanese company needs government approval, specifically from the economy ministry's investment review commission.

Speaking to reporters in Taipei, Economy Minister Kuo Jyh-huei said he could not comment on market rumours, and the ministry would only have ""certain discussions"" if it received an official ""report"" from TSMC.

""Because it involves foreign investment it would go through our investment commission. So far we have not received any information, so I have no way to comment on this issue,"" Kuo said.

U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticised Taiwan, saying it has taken away American semiconductor business and that he wants manufacturing to return to the United States.

Trump has threatened to put tariffs both on semiconductor imports and countries with which the United States has a large trade imbalance.

Taiwan runs a large trade surplus with the United States.

Earlier this month, one of the economy ministry's deputy ministers, Cynthia Kiang, visited the United States for talks.

Kuo said that trip was to ""collect information"" and talk with current and former U.S. officials.

He did not elaborate.

""AI can miss the mark from time to time, it does not understand that reports made by media outlets are different from the content produced by ordinary people.

The encrypted messaging firm replied more than five months after the May 6, 2024 limit for disclosing its online safety compliance, eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said.

In March last year, the watchdog asked Telegram and other platforms what they were doing to detect ""terrorist"", violent extremist, and child sexual exploitation content, she said in a statement.

Telegram did not reply until October 13, obstructing the commission's work for almost half a year, she said.

""Surfacing how and where some of these platforms might be failing – and also succeeding – in tackling this content is vital to protect the community and raise safety standards across the industry, especially where this most abhorrent of content is concerned.""

If it decides not to pay, the commission can seek a penalty in the federal court.

Telegram's Russian-born founder and chief executive Pavel Durov was arrested in August last year at a Paris airport and later charged with several counts of failing to curb extremist and terrorist content on the app.

Sarawak Premier Tan Sri Abang Johari Openg has agreed to the proposal made by SUPP Bawang Assan chief Kevin Lau for a bridge to be built, replacing the ferry service near Bulatan Sim­pang Tiga in Kampung Hilir.

Speaking at SUPP’s Sibu Chinese New Year open house, Abang Johari said he has instruc­ted Nangka and Pelawan assemblymen Datuk Dr Annuar Rapaee and Datuk Michael Tiang respectively to form a task force for the implementation of the project.

“Lau proposed the construction of a bridge linking Sibu town to the west bank area.

“He estimates it would be about 400m.

“If it is that length, there should be no issue, as we have built many larger bridges.”

“From there, a new road will extend towards Mukah, opening up new inland areas.

“This road will connect to other parts of Sibu, towards creating a well-developed region.”

“Our Health Depart­­ment canine unit takes dogs off the streets and rehomes them through our free adoption initiative,” says Klang mayor Datuk Abd Hamid Hussain.

“Our dog shelter at Bandar Sultan Suleiman in Port Klang is a safe haven for lost dogs,” he added.

If owners of the dogs brought to the shelter do not claim them in seven days, the animals will be put up for adoption.

Abd Hamid said adopting the canines would make a big difference to hundreds of strays that needed help.

“Currently, our Canine Unit has rounded up 139 stray dogs as of Feb 18.

“Most of these dogs are friendly and need a caring home and MBDK hopes people will adopt them instead of buying,” he said.

“The dog is then given to the new owner to be vaccinated.

“Once the vaccination is completed the owner will pay RM10 for a dog licence tag,” he said, adding that all dogs, four months and older, in the city must be licensed.

1561729,RIP photography: AI-made images now more popular than real ones,"SAN JOSE: In news no snapper or shutterbug wants to hear, Google and Scandinavian publisher Bonnier News have published research showing that artificial intelligence-generated images are proving more popular than real photographs.

After teaming up to develop a product called BonsAI, Bonnier and the Google News Initiative found in tests that the imagery it churns out usually gets higher click-through rates (CTR) than photos.

""Early results show BonsAI-generated images significantly outperform stock images in ads,"" Bonnier and Google said in a joint statement, adding that ""in several cases, the AI images delivered an astounding 100% improvement in CTR over the original images.""

While they do not advocate for the use of AI-conjured images with news articles, the Google-Bonnier tie-up follows the rapid uptake of AI by some news organisations.

By mid-2023, around half of newsrooms were using chatbots, according to a World Association of Publishers (WAN-IFRA) survey.

If publishers are tempted to use AI fakes ahead of photos, it could put an end to many photographers' hopes of making ends meet.

Getty Images, which provides news photos and stock through its iStock offering, recently agreed a US$3.7bil (RM16.3bil) merger with Shutterstock.

The announcement was greeted with criticism in some quarters, with commentators on social media nicknaming the new entity as ""Gutterstock.""

In a joint statement, the two companies said the tie-up is aimed at meeting ""evolving needs of creative, media and advertising industries through combined investment in content creation, event coverage and product and technology innovation.""

Another aim, they said, is to generate ""annual cost synergies between US$150mil (RM664mil) and US$200mil (RM885mil) by year three."" As it stands, photographers who upload to either platform can end up getting as little as US$0.10 (RM0.44) per image sale, depending on the terms and exclusivity rights. – dpa",Tech,Technology,Complimentary,Short,,2025-02-23,"Technology,AI,Camera","In news no snapper or shutterbug wants to hear, Google and Scandinavian publisher Bonnier News have published research showing that artificial intelligence-generated images are proving more popular than real photographs.",https://www.thestar.com.my/tech/tech-news/2025/02/23/rip-photography-ai-made-images-now-more-popular-than-real-ones,https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/02/20/3176995.jpeg,295
1561755,No more green speech bubbles: Customised chats arrive on Whatsapp,"BERLIN: After years of forcing all users to message in the same old green speech bubbles, WhatsApp is now opening up its interface to new chat themes that can be customised.

WhatsApp already allowed users to set an individual background photo for chats, but only now can you also set the colour of speech bubbles that display the chat messages.

You can either choose from new chat themes that are already fully configured with their own matching background or you can determine the colours for the speech bubbles and the backgrounds yourself.

One benefit to choosing individual colours and backgrounds for certain chats is that it makes you less likely to accidentally send a message to the wrong contact or group chat. If you associate, say, green with family, then you're less likely to post a private message in a group work chat that has a purple theme.

A total of 30 new stock background options are available, but you can also use your own photos.

You can also set one bespoke design globally for all chats. If preferred, you can also design each individual chat or group chat differently.

In any case, the design changes are only visible to you, and not to other contacts.

Here's how to change your chat theme:

Global: To set up a design for all chats and channels, navigate to Settings/Chats/Default chat theme.

Specific: To customise a chat individually, tap the name of the respective chat at the top on iOS. On Android, tap the three-dot menu and select ""Chat theme"".

Please note: According to Meta, the new features will only be introduced gradually. It may take a few weeks before they are available to all users and on all devices. – dpa",Tech,Mobile apps,Complimentary,Short,,2025-02-23,"Mobile apps,Technology","After years of forcing all users to message in the same old green speech bubbles, WhatsApp is now opening up its interface to new chat themes that can be customised.",https://www.thestar.com.my/tech/tech-news/2025/02/23/no-more-green-speech-bubbles-customised-chats-arrive-on-whatsapp,https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/02/20/3177017.jpeg,289

Niantic is in negotiations over the sale of its gaming business for around US$3.5bil (RM15.5bil), financial news wire Bloomberg reported on Wednesday, citing sources close to the negotiations.

The prospective buyer is said to be Scopely, a mobile games production company backed by the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund and behind titles like Star Trek Fleet Command, Scrabble Go and The Walking Dead: Road to Survival.

Pokémon Go became an instant worldwide hit when it was launched in the summer of 2016, and while the hype subsided somewhat in the years that followed, the game remained popular among a loyal fanbase.

The game was of the first major apps to make use of what is called Augmented Reality, whereby the user sees digital content mapped on top of a live feed of the real world seen through their smartphone's camera lens.

The game allows you to catch characters from the Pokémon games on your smartphone screen in real-life surroundings. Niantic has since struggled to repeat the success of the original Pokémon Go game with other titles.

Niantic also develops technology for displaying three-dimensional environments, technology that could come into play for future Scopely games.

Bloomberg reported that a deal to sell the gaming business could be announced in the coming weeks.

1562869,Man City will do well to hold marauding Reds,"DESPITE all the upheavals of the past few months, particularly those which have seen his title-winning side crumble unlike anything before in his career, Pep Guardiola will not be disillusioned by the task that awaits his team tomorrow.

Manchester City face the prospect of a second hiding this week, following their exit from the Champions League, orchestrated by Real Madrid.

Guardiola has conceded more than once in recent weeks that they are in a dark place and are finding it difficult to emerge from.

This is in stark contrast to the club’s fortunes that saw them bask in glory as they won four league titles in a row last season, and dominated the English game for the best part of a decade and a half.

The 3-1 beating at the hands of Real in Madrid, which ensured a 6-3 aggregate win for the defending champions, will be fresh in the memory when Liverpool visit, hoping to maintain their lead at the top of the Premiership.

Presently, the Reds are eight points ahead of Arsenal, who play today and could reduce that cushion somewhat.

But if City are to thwart Liverpool’s advances and consolidate their top four standing, they will need to exercise more caution in defence and hope that Norwegian Erling Haaland plays and gets among the goals.

The striker is a carrying a knee injury he picked up in the Newcastle game.

Regardless of how Guardiola approaches this fixture, the Citizens face what should be a difficult encounter.

1562567,South Korean President Yoon booked on suspicion of obstruction of arrest warrant,"SEOUL: South Korean police have booked President Yoon Suk-yeol on suspicion of obstructing the execution of a warrant issued to detain him in January, officials said Friday (Feb 21).

Yoon, who was impeached and suspended from office after his controversial imposition of martial law on Dec 3, 2024, is suspected of instructing the Presidential Security Service to prevent investigative authorities from detaining him with regard to a criminal investigation over insurrection charges.

The president had already been booked on the same charges of hindering special official duties on Jan 3 via a complaint filed by the Rebuilding Korea Party, a minor opposition party. However, as sitting president, Yoon cannot be prosecuted criminally except for insurrection or treason.

Accusations against Yoon of interfering with an arrest warrant were included in the initial request for a detention warrant for Kim Sung-hoon, the vice chief of the Presidential Security Service who is also accused of interfering with special official duties.

After being impeached in a vote by the National Assembly on Dec 14, Yoon was arrested for insurrection on Jan 15 by officials from the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials, making him the first sitting president to be taken into custody.

Following the 10th hearing in Yoon’s impeachment trial at the Constitutional Court on Thursday, the court announced it would hold the 11th and final hearing the following Tuesday.

After the final hearing, the verdict to conclude Yoon’s trial is expected to be announced in mid-March.

1562651,Deep spending cuts in Indonesia trigger protests against Prabowo,"JAKARTA (Bloomberg): Students rallied in Jakarta and other Indonesian cities on Thursday to protest President Prabowo Subianto’s state budget revamp that has threatened contractual workers’ jobs, rolled back scholarships and dimmed lighting at government offices.

In the capital, students called on the president to review his US$30-billion free meal program and cancel the $19-billion planned spending cuts, among other demands, according to a widely circulated statement.

They banded together under the ""Dark Indonesia” movement spread on social media.

Opposition is growing against Prabowo’s call for ""budget efficiency” that’s reminiscent of the deep spending cuts that are happening both in Vietnam and in the US, spearheaded by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE.

Authorities blocked a major road in the city center for the planned protest, while protesters knocked down police barriers late in the afternoon, according to local news reports.

State Secretary Prasetyo Hadi made an appearance in the rally in a bid to quell the protests. Another demonstration, involving civil society groups, is scheduled for Friday.

Students also rallied in Medan, one of the nation’s most populous cities, and in Yogyakarta. Televised footage showed hundreds of protesters in each location.

Prabowo, whose popularity was at record highs in January, doubled down on the austerity drive earlier this month, calling his critics ""little kings” who think they are immune to the law.

The budget uncertainty is adding to global trade tensions and soft economic growth that have made the Indonesian rupiah and benchmark stock index among Asia’s worst performers this year.

The rupiah has weakened 1.4% against the US dollar to-date, while the Jakarta Composite Index has shed 4.1%.

1562278,Why have thousands of applications vanished from Europe's App Store?,"Apple is starting to remove applications from its App Store in Europe in order to comply with EU legislation on digital services, which requires developers to provide precise contact information.

Over the past few days, the Cupertino-based tech firm has been carrying out a major clean-up operation in the App Stores of European Union member states, removing numerous applications that do not comply with the new requirements of the Digital Services Act (DSA). This legislation aims to strengthen transparency and accountability of developers regarding European users.

The European Digital Services Act is a piece of legislation adopted in October 2022, designed to create a safer and more transparent online environment for all Internet users. As far as online stores like Apple's App Store are concerned, the DSA imposes several obligations, starting with full transparency for app publishers. Developers must declare their trader status and provide precise contact information, such as a postal address, telephone number and email address. If this is not the case, Apple can remove their creations from its store.

Apple has already begun to remove applications whose developers have not provided the information required by the DSA from the App Store throughout the EU. More than 100,000 applications are said to be affected.

For European users, this means no future updates for applications that no longer appear in the App Store, which could quickly lead to security problems. However, this initiative is aimed above all at protecting users by ensuring that the applications available all meet high standards of transparency and accountability.

Note that Google is also required to comply with the same European legislation for its Play Store. – AFP Relaxnews",Tech,Mobile apps,Complimentary,Short,,2025-02-21,"Mobile apps,Internet","Apple is starting to remove applications from its App Store in Europe in order to comply with EU legislation on digital services, which requires developers to provide precise contact information.",https://www.thestar.com.my/tech/tech-news/2025/02/21/why-have-thousands-of-applications-vanished-from-europe039s-app-store,https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/02/21/3178041.jpg,275

The expansion is part of the firm’s plan to lessen its reliance on China and curb uncertainty around tariffs, Chua said.

The pre-fabricated houses – made by Gebbia’s startup, Samara – will first go to low-income residents whose properties burned in Altadena and Pacific Palisades neighbourhoods, according to a statement.

The Samara homes can be built in as little as five months and require only weeks to install.

The homes will be 100% funded, including installation costs. The effort is being coordinated by Steadfast LA, a non-profit started by billionaire mall developer Rick Caruso to help rebuild the city.

“This initiative is about keeping communities intact,” said Caruso, whose family foundation will also provide funding for the housing.

“We’re giving these victims a realistic way to stay on their properties and quickly return to their lives at a time when the deck is stacked against them.”

Last month’s wildfires killed at least 29 people and destroyed 16,000 structures, including 11,000 single-family homes. Economists at the University of California at Los Angeles estimated this month that total property and capital losses from the fires will be as much as US$164bil.

Gebbia, 43, joined Tesla’s board in 2022 and is worth US$9.7bil, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

The New York Times reported last week he is joining Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE, which is aggressively cutting government jobs, spending and contracts under President Donald Trump.

Gebbia launched Samara soon after leaving Airbnb full-time in 2022. The company builds and sells affordable, small homes for installation in backyards.

Earlier this week, Trump said he will announce fresh tariffs over the next month or sooner, adding lumber and forest products to previously announced plans to impose duties on imported cars, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals.

Since taking office on January 20, Trump has imposed an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports and a 25% tariff on steel and aluminium.

U.S. Federal Reserve officials are taking note of what they see as rising inflationary risks and the uncertain impact of Trump's trade, immigration, and other policies.

Fed Governor Adriana Kugler said on Thursday that given the balance of risks it is appropriate to hold the federal funds rate in place for some time.

1561489,Hackers have found a way to bypass two-factor authentication,"Hackers have developed a phishing kit capable of bypassing two-factor authentication systems, previously considered to be one of the most secure ways of protecting access to online accounts.

Two-factor authentication, which involves providing additional information (usually a code sent by email or SMS) in addition to a traditional password to log into an online service, is a recommended security measure to protect access to your most sensitive accounts. Unfortunately, this solution, which seemed to be an invincible barrier against hackers, is now being undermined by a phishing tool called Astaroth, named after the Great Duke of Hell.

Cybersecurity specialist SlashNext was the first to spot this new tool, capable of bypassing two-factor authentication on Google, Microsoft and Yahoo accounts. To achieve this, the hackers send a fraudulent link to users, directing them to a fake login page perfectly imitating the real interface of the targeted platform. When users enter their login details and secret code, this information is immediately captured and misappropriated by the cybercriminals.

What makes Astaroth particularly dangerous is its ability to intercept two-factor authentication codes in real time. According to SlashNext, the complete kit is sold on the Dark Web for US$2,000 (RM8,855).

To protect yourself against this type of attack, you should, as always, be highly vigilant and avoid clicking on suspicious links from unknown senders.

1562349,ChatGPT's OpenAI reports surge to 400 million weekly users,"Artificial intelligence powerhouse OpenAI has seen its weekly active users jump 33% to 400 million since December, the company said on Feb 20.

The San Francisco-based creator of ChatGPT also reported that its enterprise customer base has doubled to two million paying users since September, highlighting rapid adoption of AI tools across the business sector.

The company, which rocked the tech world with its release of its chatbot in 2022, however did not update the latest data for its Plus and Pro offerings, which charge customers US$20 (RM88) and US$200 (RM883) respectively.

""People hear about it through word of mouth. They see the utility of it. They see their friends using it,"" chief operating officer Brad Lightcap said in an interview with CNBC.

The figures come as OpenAI faces new competition from Chinese rival DeepSeek and legal challenges from OpenAI co-founder Elon Musk, who recently sued the company over its move to convert to a for-profit entity.

The proliferation of models and chatbots has sown doubt that the companies will be able to book a return on the massive investments needed to train the models.

Musk also released his AI company's latest ChatGPT rival Grok 3 on Monday.

OpenAI is currently in talks with SoftBank for a potential US$40bil (RM176.70bil) investment that could value the Microsoft-backed company at approximately US$300bil (RM1.32 trillion), according to CNBC.

1562239,Turtles lose two key players ahead of Kuching City tie,"PETALING JAYA: Terengganu have been hit with a double whammy before their Super League tie against Kuching City.

The Turtles will have to forget the service of influential Uzbekistani midfielder Nurillo Tukhtasinov (pic), dubbed the Mozart of the team, due to suspension.

The 28-year-old has collected three yellow cards and will have to miss the Super League tie against the Borneo side at the Sultan Mizan Stadium in Gong Badak today.

They will also play without mercurial winger Akhyar Rashid as he is sick.

Coach Badrul Afzan Razali said Akhyar had been having fever and diarrhoea the past few days.

“Our preparation has been hampered a little because we will not have our main midfielder, who is suspended,” said Badrul.

“Akram (Mahinan) could play in Nurillo’s role.”

Tukhtasinov is a regular for Terengganu, having played 33 games in all competitions, scoring five goals and making three assists.

His combination with Filipino international midfielder Manuel Ott in midfield has been superb and that’s why his absence would be felt.

Badrul will dip into his reserves list to find a replacement for Akhyar, who has played 31 games in all competitions, scoring nine goals.

“We are looking at Engku Shakir (Engku Nur Shakir Engku Yacob) to play on the flank. We also have the likes of Syafik Ismail, Hakim (Nor Hakim Hassan) and Nik Shareef (Haseefy) to look at as well.

He is also hoping they would bounce back after losing 1-2 to Kuala Lumpur.

1562831,India Sees ‘Notable’ Progress With China as Ministers Meet,"Johannesburg (Bloomberg) -- India’s foreign minister met with his Chinese counterpart Friday, saying there’s been ""some notable developments” made between the two nations in a bid to improve relations.

External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar met with China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the sidelines of the Group of 20 foreign ministers’ summit in Johannesburg, their first in-person meeting since the G-20 summit in Rio de Janeiro in November.

""Such gatherings have provided an opportunity for our interaction even when our ties were going through a difficult phase,” Jaishankar said, according to a readout of the meeting.

""We should also recognize that in a polarized global situation, our two countries have worked hard to preserve and protect the G-20 as an institution. This in itself testifies to the importance of international cooperation.”

Relations between New Delhi and Beijing soured significantly in 2020 after a series of deadly border skirmishes, with India subsequently restricting visas and investment and banning Chinese smartphone apps.

The two nations began restoring ties last year and recently agreed to resume direct flights and facilitate visas for travel.

The Friday meeting lasted about 30 minutes and the two ministers discussed ""developments in bilateral relations since their last meeting in November, specifically management of peace and tranquility in the border areas, resumption of pilgrimage, trans-border rivers, flight connectivity and travel facilitation,” Randhir Jaiswal, spokesperson for India’s Ministry of External Affairs, told reporters on Friday.

They also exchanged views about the G-20 and Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, he said.

The G-20 meeting has been marred by the US’s snub of the event. Secretary of State Marco Rubio declined to attend this week’s meeting in protest at what he said was an attempt by South Africa to promote diversity, equity and inclusion, and tackle climate change.

1562796,Harvesting fog could combat water shortages in world’s driest regions,"SOUTH-EAST ASIA (dpa): Harvesting fog could ease water scarcity in the world's driest place, a new study has suggested.

In Chile's Atacama Desert, with less annual rainfall than 1 millimetre per year, the main water source is underground water-filled spaces which last recharged between 17,000 and 10,000 years ago.

So-called fog harvesting, where fog water is collected and saved, is a feasible way to provide much needed water, scientists said in a research published in Frontiers in Environmental Science.

In a year-long field study, scientists found it was possible to collect as much as 5 litres of water per square metre each day.

Co-author of the study Virginia Carter Gamberini said the research showed it was possible to scale up fog water use, ""from a rural, rather small-scale solution to a practical water resource for cities.""

""Our findings demonstrate that fog can serve as a complementary urban water supply in drylands where climate change exacerbates water shortages,"" she said.

""The collection and use of water, especially from non-conventional sources such as fog water, represents a key opportunity to improve the quality of life of inhabitants.""

1562792,Vietnam decides to impose temporary anti-dumping tariff on China steel products,"HANOI (Reuters): Vietnam will impose a temporary anti-dumping levy of up to 27.83% on some hot-rolled coil steel products originating from China, the trade ministry said on Friday.

The tariff is expected to take effect from March 7 and will be in place for 120 days, the ministry said in a statement seen by Reuters.

Among companies hit by the duties are Baoshan Iron & Steel and Maanshan Iron & Steel

Vietnam launched an anti-dumping investigation in July following complaints from Vietnamese producers.

China's ministries of commerce and foreign affairs did not immediately reply to faxed requests for comment after business hours.

Hanoi's move comes after the US administration announced 25% tariffs

on all its steel imports earlier this month, which would take effect on March 4.

The US already imposes anti-dumping duties on multiple Vietnamese steel exports and producers, in some cases even higher than 25%.

It is unclear whether US duties on Vietnam's steel would be applied on top of existing anti-dumping measures.

“To successfully host Sukma, the estimated budget is RM250mil.

“This would cover costs such as secretariat management, athlete preparation, technical equipment setup, competition equipment, cost for the sports village inclusive of food and beverage, information and communication technology systems, logistics, transportation, security and competition venue.

“However, to cover the high cost of organising this event, the state government believes there will be sponsorship from government-linked and private companies,” he said during the Selangor State Assembly sitting at Bangunan Dewan Negeri Selangor in Shah Alam yesterday.

He was replying to a question raised by Michelle Ng (PH-Subang Jaya) on the Sukma budget.

Mohd Najwan said that lack of a main venue to host the games was Selangor’s biggest challenge.

“Phase One of Shah Alam Sports Complex (KSSA) is only expected to be completed by mid-2027.

“In addition, the preparation time for Sukma in Selangor is short – less than two years – compared to previous host states who had a longer preparation period of between four and six years before hosting the games,” he said.

To address the challenge, he said existing competition venues had been identified for use during the event.

“There is no need to build new sports infrastructure, as it is more efficient and cost-effective if all competition venues only underwent upgrades and improvements to ensure they meet the established standards,” he said.",Metro,Metro News,Complimentary,Short,Sheila Sri Priya,2025-02-21,"2026 Malaysia Games,Shah Alam Sports Complex","An estimated RM250mil is required to organise the 2026 Malaysia Games (Sukma), says Selangor youth, sports and entrepreneurship committee chairman Mohd Najwan Halimi.",https://www.thestar.com.my/metro/metro-news/2025/02/21/state-expects-sukma-2026-to-cost-rm250mil,https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/02/21/3177735.jpeg,248

Immigration director-general Datuk Zakaria Shaaban said the raids were conducted at upscale condominiums, where the centres were located, at around 11.30am on Wednesday.

“Those detained were 14 male Chinese nationals, 15 men and four women from Indonesia, a man and two women from Myanmar, two Bangladeshi men, two women from Laos and six Thai women.

“Those detained are aged between 23 and 54,” he said.

Various items were seized including four laptops, 88 mobile phones, 26 SIM cards and RM100,000 cash, he said.

“We carried out intelligence for three weeks before raiding the residential units.

“The scammers were renting the units,” he added.

Zakaria said the scammers would dupe victims by “selling” stock shares, gold and property online.

“They used social media and chat applications such as Facebook, TikTok, WhatsApp and Telegram to lure victims.

“They not only targeted locals but also foreigners from their respective home countries.

“We believe they also operated bogus online gambling,” he said.

Zakaria added that the suspects would send offers for the items directly to the victims’ mobile phones at random.

“When the victims show interest, they were required to transfer funds to an account given by the syndicate.

“The victims realised they had been duped when the seller could not be reached after the money was transferred,” he said.

A four-year-old girl’s drawings inadvertently exposed her father’s alleged cover-up in his wife’s death, according to Makkal Osai.

The girl’s artwork depicted what she witnessed, revealing the truth behind her 27-year-old mother’s death.

The mum was found hanged at their home in India’s northern state of Uttar Pradesh.

The woman’s family suspected that her death was not self-inflicted and accused her husband and mother-in-law of being responsible.

Her family paid over two million rupees in dowry during her wedding to Sandeep Budholia in 2019. But his family had reportedly continued to demand more dowry, stopping only after the woman’s father filed a police report.

The couple had three daughters, and Sandeep’s family was reportedly unhappy, blaming his wife for not having any sons.

All of this led to him allegedly beating his wife to death and staging the scene as though his wife took her own life.

He has since been arrested.

He said heavy vehicles are allowed to fit new tyres before an inspection.

However, he stressed that swapping out the new tyres with old, non-compliant ones after passing the test is unacceptable.

“The Transport Ministry is aware of concerns regarding syndicates offering tyre or spare part rentals to manipulate vehicle inspection approvals at Puspa­kom,” Hasbi told the House yesterday.

“This is an irresponsible act that compromises road safety and the integrity of the vehicle inspection system.”

The Road Transport Depart­ment has acknowledged that so-called “cosmetic agents” are offering new tyres and spare parts for rent to heavy vehicle owners who want to pass vehicle inspections.

Once the inspections are over, these parts are returned and the old parts are refitted on the vehicles.

Hasbi revealed that last year, the ministry worked closely with the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) to address misconduct among Puspakom inspectors.

“Individuals suspected of wrongdoing have been detained for questioning under the MACC Act 2009, and 20 inspection officers were investigated, of which 13 were suspended from duty,” he said.

The hearing date was fixed by Court of Appeal deputy registrar Muhammad Noor Firdaus Rosli during a case management session held on Monday.

Siti Bainun's lawyer, Haijan Omar, confirmed the hearing date to Bernama when contacted.

On May 3, 2023, the Sessions Court sentenced Siti Bainun to 12 years imprisonment after finding her guilty on two charges of neglecting and abusing the 13-year-old teenager.

She was also ordered to sign a RM5,000 five-year good behaviour bond with one surety.

Siti Bainun, 33, was further directed by the court to perform 200 hours of community services, to be completed within six months upon her release from prison.

According to the charge sheet, the abuse took place at a condominium unit in Wangsa Maju, Kuala Lumpur between February and June 2021.

Following the conviction, Siti Bainun was sent to Kajang Prison to begin serving her sentence after her application for a stay of execution was rejected by the Sessions Court.

On May 2, last year, the High Court also dismissed her appeal to overturn the conviction and sentence. She then appealed this decision at the Court of Appeal.

1562201,Scam workers return home,"Hundreds of Chinese workers were heading home yesterday after being returned from online scam centres in Myanmar, as authorities crack down on the illegal operations.

Thousands of foreigners are expected to be freed and returned from scam compounds in Myanmar in coming weeks, starting with 600 Chinese nationals over the next three days.

The compounds run by criminal gangs are staffed by foreigners, many who say they were trafficked and forced to work running internet scams swindling people around the world.

Many of those involved are Chinese, and Beijing has stepped up pressure on Myanmar and Thailand to shut the centres down.

Two double-decker coaches delivered a first group of workers across the border from Myanmar onto the tarmac of an airport in the western Thai town of Mae Sot yesterday morning.

Dozens of people, seemingly all men, boarded a special China Southern Airlines plane directly from the buses, mounting the steps after being checked by an official with a clipboard.

The plane, which had flown in from the Chinese city of Nanjing, took off shortly after 11.30am (12.30pm local time) for the border city of Xishuangbanna.

The release follows several visits by China’s Public Security Assistant Minister Liu Zhongyi to Thailand in recent weeks to arrange the repatriation.

Scam centres have proliferated across South East Asia in recent years, including in Cambodia and the Philippines, as the value of the industry has boomed to billions of dollars a year.

Many workers say they were lured or tricked into the centres by promises of high-paying jobs before they were effectively held hostage, their passports taken from them while they were forced to commit online fraud. — AFP",AseanPlus,Thailand,Complimentary,Short,,2025-02-21,Thailand,"Hundreds of Chinese workers were heading home yesterday after being returned from online scam centres in Myanmar, as authorities crack down on the illegal operations.",https://www.thestar.com.my/aseanplus/aseanplus-news/2025/02/21/scam-workers-return-home,https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/02/21/3177886.JPG,277

The Ayer Hitam MP referenced several news reports that said EPF made RM63.48bil in profits after selling the shares two years ago, which he said was untrue.

“I am concerned that this misinformation may spread, leading some to believe that the RM63.48bil profit came from selling MAHB shares in 2023.

“This figure is clearly illogical, as MAHB’s total assets are only estimated at around RM18bil,” he said in a Facebook post on Friday (Feb 21).

On Thursday (Feb 20), Finance Minister II Datuk Seri Amir Hamzah Azizan said that MAHB shares were sold at between RM6.80 to RM7.70 per unit, generating RM102mil for the EPF 2023 dividend distribution.

He said MAHB shares outperformed the Kuala Lumpur Composite Index by 11.47% in 2023, a key factor in the share sale strategy.

Dr Wee said that RM63.48bil figures cited by some media reports were actually referring to EPF’s total investment profit for the year.

“I was in the Dewan Rakyat when Amir Hamzah responded. He stated that EPF made a profit of RM102mil from selling MAHB shares in 2023.

“He also mentioned the figure of RM63.48bil as EPF’s total investment profit for 2023, meaning this was the profit from all of EPF’s investments, not just from selling MAHB shares.

1562353,Upper Thailand to experience 43°C heat this summer,"BANGKOK: From late March to mid-April this year, the upper part of Thailand could see temperatures rising to 42 or 43 degrees Celsius, the Digital Economy and Society (DES) Ministry's Anti-Fake News Centre said on Thursday (Feb 20).

The centre was verifying reports on social media that Thailand’s temperature during this summer could rise to 42 or 43°C with data from the Thai Meteorological Department.

The centre said that on Feb 6, the department forecast that the summer season this year will see extreme heat in some parts of Thailand, with temperature rising to 42 or 43°C from late March until mid-April.

However, before and after this period Thailand will see lower temperatures, the department added.

From early to mid-March, upper Thailand will experience hot days and thick fog in some areas, the department said.

However, the North and the Northeast will still experience cool temperatures in the morning due to the high-pressure system from China intermittently covering these regions, though it will be relatively weak.

From the end of March to mid-April, a low-pressure area will intermittently cover upper Thailand, while the southeasterly or southerly winds will bring moisture from the Gulf of Thailand, resulting in hot and humid weather in most of Thailand, with the highest temperatures reaching 42 to 43°C.

There will also be occasional summer storms, gusty winds, and possibly hail in some areas, which will help alleviate the heat, the department added.

As Thailand enters the transition period between seasons from mid-April to mid-May, there will be intermittent hot and humid conditions, with increasing thunderstorms.

This is due to the southeasterly or southerly winds that have been covering the upper country starting to shift to the southwest monsoon, the department said. - The Nation/ANN",AseanPlus,Thailand,Complimentary,Short,,2025-02-21,"Thailand,summer,heat,temperature","From late March to mid-April this year, the upper part of Thailand could see temperatures rising to 42 or 43 degrees Celsius, the Digital Economy and Society (DES) Ministry's Anti-Fake News Centre said on Thursday (Feb 20).",https://www.thestar.com.my/aseanplus/aseanplus-news/2025/02/21/upper-thailand-to-experience-43c-heat-this-summer,https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/02/21/3178159.jpg,289
1562439,China's military says it drove away Philippine aircraft near Spratly Islands,"BEIJING: China's military said it warned and drove away three Philippine aircraft that ""illegally intruded"" into the airspace near the Spratly Islands on Thursday (Feb 20).

There was no immediate comment from the Philippine embassy in Beijing on the Chinese military's statement issued on Friday.

China's Southern Theatre Command accused the Philippine side of attempting to ""peddle its illegal claims"" through provocation, and warned that the ""clumsy manoeuvre is doomed to failure"".

China claims sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea, a vital waterway for more than US$3 trillion of annual ship-borne commerce, putting it at odds with Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam.

A 2016 arbitration ruling invalidated China's expansive claim but Beijing does not recognise the decision.

On Thursday, the Philippines said its coast guard and fisheries bureau had jointly carried out a maritime domain awareness flight over the Kalayaan Islands, the Philippine name for Spratly Islands.

The mission was to assert the Philippines' sovereignty, sovereign rights, and maritime jurisdiction in the West Philippine Sea, it said.

More than 50 Chinese maritime militia vessels and a Chinese coast guard ship were spotted during the exercise.

It was not immediately clear if that mission, which deployed two aircraft, was the one Chinese military said it responded to.

The latest confrontation comes after Philippine coast guard accused the Chinese navy of performing dangerous flight manoeuvres earlier this week when it flew close to a government aircraft patrolling the contested Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea.

Beijing disputed that account. - Reuters",AseanPlus,Philippines,Complimentary,Short,,2025-02-21,"Philippines,China,military,South China Sea,Spratly Islands","China's military said it warned and drove away three Philippine aircraft that ""illegally intruded"" into the airspace near the Spratly Islands on Thursday (Feb 20).",https://www.thestar.com.my/aseanplus/aseanplus-news/2025/02/21/china039s-military-says-it-drove-away-philippine-aircraft-near-spratly-islands,https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/02/21/3178365.jpg,254
1562418,Rare ‘doomsday’ fish spotted flopping on Mexico beach,"NEW YORK: The elusive oarfish, a creature nicknamed the “doomsday fish” because of its place in folklore as a precursor to disaster, was captured on video in February after it was seen in shallow water in Baja California Sur, along Mexico’s Pacific Coast.

A group of people who were visiting the area spotted the fish swimming near a beach Feb 9.

Oarfish have an eel-like, slender body and gaping mouth, but the sea-monster-like creatures have rarely been seen by people.

As at August, only 20 oarfish had been recorded after they washed up along the coast of California since 1901, according to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, though one was seen in California as recently as November.

In Japanese mythology, oarfish are viewed as harbingers of doom, signalling impending earthquakes. But researchers in Japan debunked any significant link in a paper published in 2019.

Oarfish typically dwell at depths of around 650 feet (198m) but have been found living much deeper, up to 3,280 feet (1km), according to the Florida Museum of Natural History. - NYTIMES",News,World,Complimentary,Short,,2025-02-21,"Mexico,doomsday,fish","The elusive oarfish, a creature nicknamed the ""doomsday fish"" because of its place in folklore as a precursor to disaster, was captured on video in February after it was seen in shallow water in Baja California Sur, along Mexico's Pacific Coast.",https://www.thestar.com.my/news/world/2025/02/21/rare-doomsday-fish-spotted-flopping-on-mexico-beach,https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/02/21/3178325.jpg,176
1562284,Argentina court clears 3 accused in singer Liam Payne's death,"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) -An Argentine court has cleared three of the five people accused of their alleged involvement in singer Liam Payne's death, local media reported on Thursday.

The court dismissed charges against businessman Rogelio Nores, a friend of Payne's who reportedly acted as his manager, and two employees of the hotel where Payne died, according to local outlet Infobae.

The court also upheld the pre-trial detention of an employee of the same hotel and a waiter at a local restaurant, who have been detained since the beginning of last month.

Both are accused of plying Payne, who shot to fame as part of the boyband One Direction, with cocaine during his stay in Buenos Aires, and face up to 15 years in prison if convicted.

Payne fell to his death from a hotel balcony in October.

The court did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

1562276,"Trump administration cuts duration of deportation protections for 521,000 Haitians","WASHINGTON -U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Thursday cut the duration of deportation protections and work permits for 521,000 Haitians covered by the Temporary Protected Status program so that they will expire in August, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said.

The decision reverses a Biden administration move last year to extend the protections through February 2026, the spokesperson said, saying the extension was unjustified.

President Donald Trump, a Republican, tried to end most enrollment in the TPS program during his 2017-2021 presidency but was blocked by federal courts. Noem earlier this month revoked a Biden-era TPS extension for some 600,000 Venezuelans and terminated the status for half of them, whose protections and access to work permits expire in April.

Trump falsely said during a September 2024 debate with Democrat Kamala Harris that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating pets, sparking fear of retaliation among Haitians in the city. Trump said a month later that if elected he would revoke TPS for Haitians and deport them.

Noem will now need to decide whether to terminate the status for Haitians.

“President Trump and I are returning TPS to its original status: temporary,"" she said in a statement.

More than a million people, over half of them children, are now displaced within Haiti where gang violence continues unabated despite the start of a United Nations-backed security mission last year, U.N. data published in January showed.

Haiti has lacked elected representatives since 2023 and has not held elections since 2016. The country's capital is almost entirely controlled by armed gangs, and leaders have said security must first be established to hold a free and fair vote.

On Wednesday, Sihem Ben Sedrine, a veteran politician‮ ‬and head of the Truth and Dignity Commission, was also released after months of detention. Riadh Mouakhar, a former minister, was also freed on Thursday.

The move comes two days after the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights urged Tunisia to end the arrests, arbitrary detentions and jailing of humans rights defenders, lawyers, journalists and politicians

Dozens of senior politicians, including Abir Moussi, leader of the Free Constituonal Party, and Rached Ghannouchi, the head on Ennahda's party, two of Saied’s most prominent opponents, remain in prison since 2023.

Boughalleb, was jailed last year, on charge of insulting a public official, which the journalists union said was aimed at silencing the voices of journalists.

Saied seized extra powers in 2021 when he shut down the elected parliament and moved to rule by decree before assuming authority over the judiciary.

Since Tunisia’s 2011 revolution, press freedom has been a key gain for Tunisians and its media has become one of the most open of any Arab state.

However, politicians, journalists and unions say that freedom of the press now faces a serious threat under Saied's rule. The president, who came to power in 2019 in elections, who has rejected such accusations, saying he will not become a dictator.

1562430,Philippine police arrest over 450 in 'Chinese-run' scam centre raid,"MANILA: Philippine police arrested more than 450 people in a raid on an allegedly Chinese-run offshore gaming operator in Manila, the country's anti-organised crime commission has said.

Initial interrogations suggested the suburban site had been operating as a scam centre, targeting victims in China and India with sports betting and investment schemes, the commission said after the Thursday (Feb 20) raid, which saw 137 Chinese nationals detained.

""We arrested around five Chinese bosses,"" said commission chief Gilberto Cruz on Friday, adding they faced potential trafficking charges.

Banned by President Ferdinand Marcos last year, Philippine online gaming operators, or Pogos, are said to be used as cover by organised crime groups for human trafficking, money laundering, online fraud, kidnappings and even murder.

""This raid proves that the previous Pogo workers are still trying to continue their scamming activities despite the ban,"" Cruz said.

He previously told AFP that about 21,000 Chinese nationals have continued to operate smaller-scale scam operations in the country since the online gaming ban.

International concern has grown in recent years over similar scam operations in other Asian nations that are often staffed by trafficking victims tricked or coerced into promoting bogus cryptocurrency investments and other cons.

President Marcos has put Pogos at the centre of recent campaign messaging in the run-up to May mid-term elections, framing predecessor Rodrigo Duterte's alleged tolerance of the sites as evidence of a too-cozy relationship with China.

Thursday's raid is the latest in a series of busts this year, including one in January that saw around 400 foreigners arrested in the capital, including many Chinese nationals.

A group of 200 Chinese citizens suspected of involvement in call centre fraud returned to China on Thursday under the escort of Chinese police after being repatriated from Myawaddy in Myanmar, the report said.

The suspects were first sent to Thailand's Mae Sot district in Tak province, which shares a border with Myawaddy, before being flown back to China on four chartered flights. They arrived at an airport in Nanjing, the capital of eastern Jiangsu province.

The ministry added that more than 800 other fraud suspects are expected to be repatriated in the coming days.

According to the ministry, law enforcement authorities from the three countries recently launched a joint telecom fraud operation in Myawaddy.

Thailand has cut off electricity, internet and fuel supplies to Myawaddy, and strengthened patrols to prevent illegal border crossings by individuals involved in scams, it said.

Myanmar, meanwhile, has deployed forces to raid telecom fraud compounds in Myawaddy, arrested fraud suspects, and rescued Chinese nationals trapped in scam operations, it added.

The ministry also vowed to continue to dismantle telecom fraud compounds and effectively safeguard the lives and property of Chinese citizens.

Its chairman Datuk Katherin Lee said while efforts were being done to create more awareness on this matter, the fact is that there are still many challenges for these people to get back into the community due to stigma.

She said this applies also to those who are released on licence, meaning those that are still serving their jail sentence but, outside, with restrictions and regulations in place.

“We see many who are released under licence are facing tough times trying to secure jobs, places to live and to readjust to life in the community,” she said in a statement after paying a courtesy call to the Yang di-Pertua Negeri Sabah Tun Musa Aman, Thursday (Feb 20).

There are also many whose families have disowned them, making it even harder for these people to move on and try to be better in life, Lee said.

She said other than families, private and government sectors can consider playing bigger roles in hiring ex-convicts so that at least, they have a chance to turn over a new leave, rebuild their lives and never have to sort to criminal acts anymore.

“We want these people to contribute to the society, country and their family,” she stressed.

Lee suggested some form of incentive programme to be introduced and enforced here, just like the one in Singapore where employers who hire former inmates get incentives and salary subsidies.

This method has proven to work and she hopes Sabah can emulate such a working model.

1562340,Philippines makes first frozen durian shipment to China,"MANILA: The Philippines expanded its presence in the global market by making its first frozen durian shipment to China valued at P8.2 million (US$0.14 million).

In a statement on Thursday (Feb 20), the Department of Agriculture (DA) said Davao City-based company Maylong Enterprises Corp. delivered 1,050 boxes of frozen durian meat and 300 boxes of durian paste to Nansha District in Guangzhou.

Maylong Enterprises became the first Philippine enterprise that secure the approval of the General Administration of Customs of the People’s Republic of China to supply frozen durian meat and paste to its country.

A previous report from the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations noted that China has been the main driver of global durian exports, as the East Asian country consumes more than 90 per cent of durian supply worldwide.

The DA said the shipment of durian, also known as king of fruits marked a “key moment” for the agriculture sector. It was shipped on Feb. 11 and is expected to arrive on Feb. 18.

“This historic shipment strengthens the Philippines’ presence in international markets, opening the door to future growth and solidifying the country’s reputation as a leading producer of world-class durian,” the DA said.

The Davao Region is the leading domestic producer of durian and accounts for more than two-thirds of total production based on the latest government data available.

“From the fertile soils of Davao Region to China’s bustling markets, our frozen durian represents the hopes and dreams of countless farmers,” said Macario Gonzaga, DA Region XI executive director. - Philippine Daily Inquirer/ANN",AseanPlus,Philippines,Complimentary,Short,,2025-02-21,"Philippines,China,frozen durian shipment",MANILA: The Philippines expanded its presence in the global market by making its first frozen durian shipment to China valued at P8.2 million (US$0.14 million,https://www.thestar.com.my/aseanplus/aseanplus-news/2025/02/21/philippines-makes-first-frozen-durian-shipment-to-china,https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/02/21/3178150.jpg,261

1562298,Ringgit rises as US$ weakens on cautious sentiment,"KUALA LUMPUR: The ringgit rose against the US dollar in early trade as investors remained cautious about the policies of US President Donald Trump's administration, particularly on tariffs and geopolitics, an analyst said.

At 8 am, the ringgit strengthened to 4.4040/4310 from 4.4270/4320 at Thursday’s close.

Bank Muamalat Malaysia Bhd chief economist Dr Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid said the greenback weakened amid a decline in US Treasury yields and falling equity prices, as investors assessed corporate earnings.

""The latest earnings report from Walmart, a key US retailer, highlighted that uncertainties in consumer behaviour, global economic conditions, and geopolitics are expected to affect its financial performance this year,” he told Bernama today.

Mohd Afzanizam noted that US retail sales fell 0.9 per cent month-on-month in January, reinforcing concerns over economic uncertainty.

He added that the US Dollar Index stood at 106.372 points after previously surpassing 107.

""A weaker economic outlook should normally be followed by the anticipation of monetary easing by the central bank.

""However, such an argument is at odds with indications from the US Federal Reserve, as it is not in a rush to reduce the Federal Funds Rate,” he added.

Meanwhile, the ringgit traded mostly higher against major currencies.

It strengthened against the Japanese yen to 2.9435/9619 from 2.9454/9490 and gained against the British pound to 5.5794/6136 from 5.5833/5896. However, it slipped against the euro to 4.6238/6521 from 4.6196/6248.

1562333,12-year-old Thai girl in critical condition after vaping for two years,"BANGKOK: A 12-year-old girl in Buri Ram has been diagnosed with severe lung damage, reportedly caused by vaping for two years.

Her family was completely unaware of her habit until they were informed by her school.

The girl’s grandmother, Ae, was shocked when teachers at her school in Tambon Don Mon, Satuek district, informed her of the diagnosis.

The girl’s case was first revealed on Facebook by Paphawarin Simlakorn, a rescue worker from Tambon Don Mon Municipality, who posted a warning urging parents to closely monitor their children for vaping habits.

Paphawarin reported that he had recently transported three students—a fifth grader, a sixth grader, and an eighth grader—to hospital after they suffered from shortness of breath and chest pain due to vaping.

According to the local rescue office, a 15-year-old student in the same township died in January after prolonged e-cigarette use.

Ae explained that her granddaughter had always been a diligent and hardworking student, but her behaviour changed noticeably when she entered Grade 4. She stopped helping with household chores and frequently left home, claiming she was studying with friends.

She was later admitted to Satuek Hospital after experiencing shortness of breath, vomiting, and extreme weakness. Doctors discovered that almost 100 per cent of her lungs had been damaged due to vaping.

1558914,Toxic metals found in certain protein powders,"Gym-goers can sometimes be seen clutching protein shakes as if in possession of a magic muscle-building elixir or a tin of Popeye’s spinach, gulping down mouthfuls between sets and furtive mirror glances.

But there is a 50-50 chance the powders used to make the shakes contain amounts of toxic metals deemed unsafe in some quarters.

That’s according to the Clean Label Project, whose mission, its executive director Jaclyn “Jackie” Bowen says, is “to uncover the hidden risks of environmental contaminants and toxins lurking in everyday products”.

The United States-based non-profit organisation said that it tested 160 products produced by 70 brands – equivalent to 83% of the US protein powder market – and found that 47% contained levels of metal exceeding the threshold in Prop 65, a California state law known officially as the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986.

Plant-based proteins were found to have higher levels of metals in them than whey powders, while chocolate-flavoured powders had four times as much lead as vanilla powders, and organic mixes had three times the amount of cadmium as whey powders.

If they don’t lead to people eating more chicken, eggs, fish and meat to get their protein, they should at least serve as “a wake-up call for consumers, manufacturers, retailers and regulators”, the Clean Label Project said, adding that there needs to be “stricter safety standards to protect consumers from long-term exposure to these contaminants”.

“Consumers are purchasing supplement and protein products for health and performance; they expect the products to be clean,” Bowen noted. – dpa",Lifestyle,Nutrition,Complimentary,Short,,2025-02-21,"Nutrition,Protein shake,fitness,nutrition,diet",Fitness enthusiasts who consume these supplements should be aware of this health issue.,https://www.thestar.com.my/lifestyle/health/2025/02/21/toxic-metals-found-in-certain-protein-powders,https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/02/17/3171768.jpeg,260

Penang deputy police chief Datuk Mohd Alwi Zainal Abidin said telecommunications-related scams accounted for the highest number, with 2,938 cases resulting in RM101.5mil in losses.

""This was followed by e-commerce fraud, which recorded 2,204 cases with losses of RM34.3mil. Meanwhile, non-existent investment scams saw a sharp spike, with 1,242 cases recording the highest losses at RM126.8mil.

""Overall, online crime in the state continues to rise in both numbers and financial losses, reflecting the evolving tactics of scammers and their growing financial impact on victims,"" Mohd Alwi told reporters after launching the ""Elak Kena Scam"" QR Code Scam Awareness campaign.

The initiative was organised by the Penang branch of the Malaysian Crime Prevention Foundation (MCPF) in collaboration with Penang police. Also present was Penang MCPF chairman Datuk Seri Ong Poh Eng.

Mohd Alwi said that, on average, seven online scams were reported daily last year, with victims losing an estimated RM36,164 each. He emphasised that such significant figures demonstrate the importance of campaigns like QR Code Scam Awareness.

""Online fraud victims come from all walks of life, including lecturers, teachers, and factory workers. In most non-existent investment scams, victims are deceived by promises of high returns,"" he said.

On the campaign, he said it features easy-to-understand infographics and is designed to educate the public on steps to avoid falling victim to fraud.

1561814,'No to drugs' signboards mooted as condition for concert permit,"SHAH ALAM: The Selangor police have suggested setting up ‘No To Drugs’ signboards or placards at entry points into concert locations as a condition to apply for organising concerts in the state.

Selangor police chief Datuk Hussein Omar Khan said it was part of their recommendations to the state government and the Housing and Local Government Ministry early this month as efforts to curb drug taking at entertainment events.

It would also tighten conditions to concert organisers who previously would only place such reminders on concert tickets, he added.

""This will indirectly help curb the use of drugs at concerts. The suggestion will be placed in the permit conditions for organising entertainment events issued by local authorities,” he said at a media conference here on Thursday (Feb 20).

The Selangor police were reported to have suggested the need for new guidelines for organising concerts, including the number of attendees according to the venue’s capacity as well as security aspects such as the sale of drugs and ventilation.

This move follows the suspected drug-related deaths of four individuals while attending a Pinkfish concert in Bandar Sunway at the end of last year, of which three deaths were subsequently confirmed to have been due to drug stimulants.

Hussein also said that the police had briefed the Youth and Sports Minister on the results of the investigation into the deaths at the Pinkfish concert and shared suggested additional measures for concert organisers.

""The police also provide our commitment to increasing intelligence gathering prior and during concerts to prevent drug taking and to avoid fatalities from such use,” he added. - Bernama",News,Nation,Complimentary,Short,,2025-02-20,"concert,No To Drugs signboard,concert organiser,permit conditions",SHAH ALAM: The Selangor police have suggested setting up 'No To Drugs' signboards or placards at entry points into concert locations as a condition to apply for organising concerts in the state.,https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2025/02/20/039no-to-drugs039-signboards-mooted-as-condition-for-concert-permit,https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/02/20/3177147.JPG,268

The initiative is seen as Indonesia’s response to China's DeepSeek chatbot.

Luhut Pandjaitan, a senior economic advisor to Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, announced at the Indonesia Economic Summit in Jakarta that a dedicated team has been formed to build the country’s own version of DeepSeek.

The yet-to-be-named chatbot, set to be presented to Prabowo early next month, will support both Indonesian and English.

Luhut did not disclose the development cost but emphasised that it was affordable.

Arsjad Rasjid, chairman of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, urged private sector collaboration to drive AI innovation and strengthen Indonesia’s digital economy.

Indonesia is also drafting AI regulations, considering DeepSeek’s role in the digital landscape.

Deputy Minister of Communications and Digital Affairs Nezar Patria stated that the chatbot would be reviewed before any decision on its regulation or potential ban.

According to last year’s e-Conomy SEA report, AI-related searches in South-East Asia surged 11 times between 2020 and 2024, reflecting strong interest from the region’s young, digital-savvy population.

Peninsula Hotels, a luxury hotel group, was planning to build a US$130 million hotel in Yangon.

The decision was made due to the political situation in Myanmar, and all investments in the project have been written off, the report said.

Regarding the shelved project in downtown Yangon, the board explained that the development work for the project is still on hold and the prospects for Myanmar’s tourism market remain uncertain, the report said.

The project will be halted and a loss of HK$160 million (estimated US$20.51 million) will be recorded, the report added.

""Secretary Bessent emphasized the importance of the U.S.-Hungary relationship and continued coordination between the two countries at this important time for Europe,"" the Treasury said in a readout of the meeting, which it described as introductory.

The statement did not include any references to Russia's war in Ukraine nor President Donald Trump's desire to end it quickly by kicking off talks with Moscow, a move that has alarmed European leaders.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's nationalist government has long been at loggerheads with Hungary's Western allies on a range of issues, including its relatively good economic ties with Russia, media freedoms and human rights issues.

Former president Joe Biden's administration in December granted Hungary an exemption from sanctions on Russia's Gazprombank, a move that allows Hungary to continue to make payments for Russian gas via the financial institution.

Earlier on Wednesday, sources told Reuters that Bessent would skip a G20 finance ministers and central bank governors meeting in South Africa next week, a gathering where he would be able to meet with multiple counterparts from the world's largest economies.

1561493,‘Like science fiction’: Alarm as SpaceX rocket lights up German skies,"ESSEN, Germany: Mysterious flashing lights in the sky caused alarm across Germany on Tuesday night, with authorities confirming that a rocket used by US space company SpaceX was the cause.

Germany's Space Component Command, a branch of the German Air Force, said on Wednesday that there was no evidence that debris fell over Germany.

The lights were caused due to the re-entry of parts of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket into the Earth's atmosphere, a spokesman for the command said.

The rocket was launched from the United States on Feb 1.

Numerous residents called German police to report unusual lights in the sky shortly after midnight.

Germany's UFO reporting agency, CENAP, said it recorded some 120 calls early on Wednesday.

A man from Lichtenfels in the western state of Hesse told the hr3 radio station that he was fertilizing his field when he saw the lights.

""Something split up, there were glowing stripes in white, red and orange, and then it slowly disappeared into the horizon. It was somehow phenomenal,"" he said. ""It looked more like a science fiction film – as if aliens were landing.""

SpaceX, founded by billionaire Elon Musk, has carried out several launches from Florida for its Starlink satellite internet provider in recent weeks, including on Tuesday night.

While the first stage of the rocket is reusable, the second stage burns up when it re-enters the atmosphere, sometimes weeks after the launch.

The space command spokesman said the rockets can burn up in the sky across the planet, with the part that caused alarm on Tuesday night having re-entered the atmosphere somewhere over Great Britain or Northern Ireland. – dpa",Tech,Technology,Complimentary,Short,,2025-02-20,Technology,"Mysterious flashing lights in the sky caused alarm across Germany on Tuesday night, with authorities confirming that a rocket used by US space company SpaceX was the cause.",https://www.thestar.com.my/tech/tech-news/2025/02/20/like-science-fiction-alarm-as-spacex-rocket-lights-up-german-skies,https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/02/20/3176476.JPG,274
1560494,Quantum camera could help detect cancer as soon as it forms,"The imminent development of quantum cameras promises to transform many sectors, starting with medicine. Thanks to images of unprecedented precision, this technology could, for example, help detect the presence of cancer cells in their earliest stages of formation.

A quantum camera is a cutting-edge device capable of detecting individual photons, the smallest units of light. This technology relies on ultra-precise sensors that capture each photon and transform it into a detectable electronic signal. Unlike traditional cameras, a quantum camera is therefore capable of perceiving tiny amounts of light. This makes it possible to create very detailed images, even in very low light conditions.

Researchers at the Institute for Quantum Computing at the University of Waterloo in Canada have announced significant advances in this field. Two doctoral students, Sarah Odinotski and Jack DeGooyer, are working on the design of microcircuits capable of processing the weak signals generated by photon sensors. Their goal is to create the most precise camera possible, offering near-perfect sensitivity.

One of the first practical uses of this type of technology could be in the medical world. This discovery could, for example, be used in the detection of abnormalities in biological tissues – starting with the formation of cancer cells – much earlier than current methods allow. By capturing images with an unprecedented level of detail, these quantum cameras could offer doctors the possibility of diagnosing and treating serious illnesses much more quickly.

One of the most promising applications of this technology is in the field of medical imaging. Thanks to their extreme sensitivity, quantum cameras could, in the future, greatly facilitate the work of doctors and researchers. – AFP Relaxnews",Tech,Camera,Complimentary,Short,,2025-02-20,"Camera,Technology,Healthcare","The imminent development of quantum cameras promises to transform many sectors, starting with medicine.

1560492,This robotic hand features real human tissue,"Japanese researchers have developed the first biohybrid hand capable of performing complex gestures using human muscle tissue grown in a laboratory. This could pave the way for unprecedented uses.

Scientists at the University of Tokyo and Waseda University in Japan have succeeded in developing a unique biohybrid hand. The key to this innovation lies in the use of multiple muscle tissue actuators (MuMuTA), hybrid structures combining living tissue and 3D-printed plastic that convert an energy source into mechanical movement or action.

These actuators are capable of contracting and relaxing, mimicking the functions of human muscles to achieve autonomous movement. Organized in a structured way, they can then perform complex gestures, thanks to their ability to contract and coordinate fluidly.

This biohybrid hand is now capable of performing relatively complex gestures, such as the scissor action. In fact, this technology represents a significant advance in the development of future biohybrid limbs, ever more realistic and capable of imitating real human movements.

Future applications of this technology look promising. It could revolutionize the field of biohybrid prostheses, offering amputees the possibility of regaining a much more natural form of mobility than with current prostheses. In the future, this type of innovation could also have a major impact on pharmaceutical testing, in the case of drugs specifically targeting muscle tissue.

Finally, the whole field of robotics could one day benefit from these advances, with the arrival of humanoid robots capable of simulating perfectly and infinitely human movements applied to very specific tasks.

This research is published in the journal Science Robotics. – AFP Relaxnews",Tech,Robotics,Complimentary,Short,,2025-02-20,"Robotics,Technology",Japanese researchers have developed the first biohybrid hand capable of performing complex gestures using human muscle tissue grown in a laboratory.

1561357,Google develops AI co-scientist to aid researchers,"LONDON (Reuters) - Google has developed an AI tool to act as a virtual collaborator for biomedical scientists, the U.S. blue chip said on Wednesday.

The new tool, tested by scientists at Stanford University in the U.S. and Imperial College London, uses advanced reasoning to help scientists synthesize vast amounts of literature and generate novel hypotheses, the company said.

AI is being increasingly deployed in the workplace, from answering calls to carrying out legal research, following the success of ChatGPT and similar models over the past year.

Google's AI unit, DeepMind, has made science a priority, and DeepMind boss Demis Hassabis was a co-recipient of a Nobel Prize in Chemistry last year for technology developed in the AI unit.

In an experiment on liver fibrosis, Google said all the approaches suggested by its new AI co-scientist showed promising activity and potential to inhibit causes of disease.

It showed the capacity to improve solutions generated by experts over time, Google added.

""While this is a preliminary finding requiring further validation, it suggests a promising avenue for capable AI systems... to augment and accelerate the work of expert scientists,"" it said.

The scientists who worked on the project said it would complement rather than replace researchers.

""We expect that it will... increase, rather than decrease scientific collaboration,"" Google scientist Vivek Natarajan said.

1561207,Ex-Intel executives raise $21.5 million for RISC-V chip startup,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Newly formed chip startup AheadComputing on Wednesday said it had raised $21.5 million in seed funding.

Co-founded by several former Intel central processing unit (CPU) engineers and executives, the company plans to build technology and chips based on the open source architecture called RISC-V, pronounced ""risk five.""

AheadComputing plans to use the funds to design and develop CPU technology that aims to solve some of the computing performance issues that have arisen around artificial intelligence, such as bandwidth shortages and data processing limitations.

Co-founder and CEO Debbie Marr said it was an opportune moment for a startup that relieson RISC-V technology because it avoids the pitfalls of the x86 architecture used by Intel and Advanced Micro Devices and the problems associatedwith relying on a single supplier - Arm Holdings - for the underlying designs.

""The RISC-V ecosystem is open, it's not owned, it's not controlled by one company,"" Marr said in an interview with Reuters. ""There are hundreds of players. There is plenty of room for innovation.""

Marr and other senior executives left last year and founded AheadComputing, which is headquartered in Portland. Marr and other AheadComputing executives were responsible for developing several key technologies at Intel that significantlyimproved CPU performance.

The seed funding round was led by Eclipse Ventures and included Maverick Capital, Fundomo and EPIQ Capital Group. Former Apple and Tesla chip architect Jim Keller invested in the round as well. Keller runs his own RISC-V venture called Tenstorrent.

Founding the company was attractive because of the growing demand for high-performance computing, Eclipse partner Greg Reichow said in an interview. By 2030, it will be roughly $100 billion, he said.

""There's a big market tailwind in this,"" Reichow said.

1561161,"Italy working on alternative to Musk's Starlink, minister says","ROME (Reuters) - Italy is aiming to develop its own low-orbit satellites for government communications, its industry minister said on Wednesday, presenting it as an alternative to systems provided by U.S. billionaire Elon Musk.

Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's government had previously said it was considering the use of Musk's Starlink satellites to provide encrypted communications between officials operating in risky areas.

The suggestion was sharply criticised by opposition politicians, who questioned the wisdom of handing a national security contract to a foreign entrepreneur who is also part of the U.S. government under President Donald Trump.

""We are in fact working on the creation of a national low-orbit satellite system developed independently, with the involvement of the main national players,"" Minister Adolfo Urso said in the lower house of parliament.

Urso, a member of Meloni's right-wing Brothers of Italy party, said that would offer a competitive alternative to infrastructure provided by other global operators, including Musk.

Urso did not give a timing for the development of the project and did not specify which companies the government had called in, but said the national space agency would carry out a feasibility study.

Musk has a warm relationship with Meloni and said last month he would be ready to offer his services to Italy. However, Defence Minister Guido Crosetto denied an agreement had been sealed.

Starlink, part of Musk's SpaceX aerospace business, has 6,700 active satellites in low earth orbit. A source told Reuters that Italy was considering a five-year deal with the company worth 1.5 billion euros ($1.57 billion).

1562067,Ukraine's foreign minister discussed 'lasting peace' with US envoy,"(Reuters) - Ukrainian foreign minister Andrii Sybiha said on Thursday he had discussed ways to achieve a just and lasting peace in the conflict with Russia in talks with U.S. special envoy Keith Kellogg.

Kellogg's visit to Kyiv comes at a difficult time in diplomatic terms for Ukraine after U.S. President Donald Trump effectively ended Russian leader Vladimir Putin's political isolation, engaged in bilateral talks with Moscow, and has since echoed Russian lines regarding Ukraine.

""I affirmed Ukraine's willingness to achieve peace through strength and our vision for the necessary steps,"" Sybiha said on X.

He reiterated to Kellogg, who arrived in the Ukrainian capital on Wednesday and said he would ""sit and listen"" as part of his mission, that the security of Ukraine and the transatlantic ""is indivisible"".

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy plans a meeting with Kellogg on Thursday. The envoy already met Ukraine's army top commander, heads of intelligence and special services.

In the past two days, Trump said Ukraine ""should never have started"" the war, launched by Russia in 2022, called Zelenskiy a ""dictator without elections"" and spread false data about his political ratings.

Zelenskiy responded to accusations saying Trump was trapped in ""disinformation bubble"", with falsehoods coming from Russia, but later in the day said he was counting on American pragmatism.

""They need to tone it down and take a hard look and sign that deal,"" Mike Waltz, the White House national security adviser, said in an interview with Fox News.

Pushback from Ukraine on the minerals deal and how Trump is carrying out peace talks is simply unacceptable, Waltz said, given everything the United States has done for Ukraine.

Waltz's comments come a day after Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy traded insults, with Trump calling Zelenskiy a dictator and Zelenskiy saying the U.S. president was living in a disinformation bubble and spewing talking points from Moscow.

However, Waltz said U.S. differences with Ukraine were not irreconcilable, saying: ""The president also said how much he loves the Ukrainian people.""

Ukraine and European leaders have balked at being left out of peace talks begun after Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by telephone last week.

Waltz denied that U.S. allies and Ukraine were not being consulted.

""There's a term for this in diplomacy. It's called shuttle diplomacy, because bringing everybody to the table at once just hasn't worked in the past,"" he said.

""So we've engaged one side, we've engaged the other side, and then we're going to have a process moving forward under President Trump's direction and leadership.""

1562020,Swedish police say their intervention in mass shooting prevented more deaths,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Swedish police said on Thursday that their intervention in a mass shooting earlier this month had prevented even more deaths in the country's worst-ever killing spree.

The shooter, identified by Reuters and other media as Rickard Andersson, shot dead 10 people during a 15-minute killing spree on February 4 before turning the gun on himself at the Campus Risbergska adult education centre in the city of Orebro. The motive remains unclear.

Police arrived at the scene some six minutes after the alarm was first received and came under fire, but it took them an hour to find the shooter's body, leading to questions from the media and some survivors about their handling of the incident.

Police said the campus was an ""inferno"" when officers arrived and that Andersson had let off three smoke grenades, making navigation difficult.

""After the perpetrator opened fire at our patrol only two more shots were fired,"" Deputy Regional Police Chief Niclas Hallgren told a press conference. ""A shotgun blast that didn't hit anyone and another shot that ended the perpetrator's life.""

Andersson, a 35-year-old unemployed recluse who owned four licensed firearms, killed himself twelve minutes after the first alarm. His body was found in the school next to three guns. He had fired 70 shots and had over 100 unused cartridges left, police said.

Police reiterated that they believe Andersson selected the victims at random and said they were sifting through vast amounts of material but had yet to find a clear motive for the attack.

As the war with Russia enters a fourth year, Ukraine is heavily dependent on foreign financial aid to cover its social and humanitarian spending needs, with the bulk of Ukrainian state revenue going towards funding the defence effort.

It is the seventh regular review of Ukraine's $15.6-billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme, the IMF said in a statement, and economists have said meeting its reform targets could pose challenges for Ukraine.

It includes goals to pass amendments to the country's criminal code and approve legislation to set up an administrative court. Parliament has not considered the draft bills yet.

Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on the Telegram messaging app that the government expected to receive a total of $2.7 billion from the IMF over the course of this year.

""Cooperation with the fund is an important factor in our financial stability,"" Shmyhal said. ""Despite the full-scale war, we continue to transform (the economy) and implement the necessary reforms.""

Since Russia's invasion in February 2022, the IMF has provided a total of $12.4 billion to Ukraine, Shmyhal added.

Finance ministry data showed that the country had received more than $118 billion in foreign financial aid from its allies since the start of the war.

The immigration order bars the use of federal money for migrants in the country illegally, directing all agencies to identify any federally funded programs that do so.

The executive action also ensures that federal funds cannot be used by state or local ""sanctuary"" jurisdictions, according to the White House. Sanctuary cities prevent local law enforcement from assisting federal civil immigration officers.

In another order, Trump instructed the heads of every agency to undertake a review of all regulations, working with members of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. Any regulations that are deemed inconsistent with the administration's policies will be rescinded or modified, the order said.

The action aims to bolster Musk's sweeping government-slashing effort, which is facing numerous court challenges over its lawfulness.

Trump also targeted a number of advisory committees and agencies for elimination, part of his broader campaign to assert control over independent executive agencies.

Among the agencies set to be disbanded are the United States Institute for Peace, which promotes conflict resolution around the world; the Inter-American Foundation, which funds community development programs in Latin America and the Caribbean; and the U.S. African Development Foundation, which invests in community development efforts in Africa.

1556909,Do you frequently suffer from cold feet?,"Do your feet always feel cold, even when it’s not chilly outside?

While cold weather can be a common cause, persistent cold feet might point to something more – like circulatory issues, immune problems or nerve disorders.

Mayo Clinic family medicine physician Dr Jesse Bracamonte says it’s important to seek medical advice if the condition persists.

Getting evaluated can help identify and treat any underlying health conditions.

Sometimes, cold feet simply mean that you need warmer socks.

But if your feet are always cold, no matter the weather, it might be something more.

“Anything from circulatory problems, not having adequate blood flow, heart condition problems, immune or autoimmune conditions such as thyroid disease, and sometimes, nerve or neuropathic problems – having nerve disorders can cause cold feet,” he says.

Where to start?

Dr Bracamonte offers a few immediate steps.

“Warm socks, lifting your feet, staying hydrated, diet, nutrition is really important.

“Exercise is important.

“And, obviously, if you smoke, don’t smoke,” he says.

If your feet remain feeling cold but are not cold to the touch, it might be time to see your healthcare team.

“There are certain tests that can be easily be done to ensure that you have no circulatory issues, and a few blood tests may be warranted just to make sure you have no autoimmune issues, or even signs of anaemia,” he says. – Mayo Clinic News Network/Tribune News Service",Lifestyle,Wellness,Complimentary,Short,,2025-02-20,"Wellness,Feet","This is might be due to cool temperatures, but it could also be a sign of a health problem.",https://www.thestar.com.my/lifestyle/health/2025/02/20/do-you-frequently-suffer-from-cold-feet,https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/02/14/3167238.jpg,234

Film distributor Encore Films announced on social media on Feb 14 that Ne Zha 2 is coming soon to cinemas in South-East Asia.

He recently appeared on the music reality show, Infinity Beyond: Greater Bay Area Season, sharing insights into his disciplined lifestyle with Chinese singer Li Hao.

Kwok revealed that he follows an unconventional routine – going to bed at 6am and waking up at 1pm daily.

“I don’t eat during the day, just a simple slice of bread is enough,” he said.

The Rob N Roll (2024) star added that he doesn’t eat much, having just one meal a day.

Addressing the reason behind his strict routine, Kwok – who’s married to Chinese model Moka Fang – said he gains weight easily.

He went on to recall the struggles he faced with his weight during his early career in Taiwan in the 1990s.

“I used to be very fat. After you’ve been fat, you will not allow yourself to go through the same thing again,” Kwok said.

In addition to maintaining a strict diet, the Heavenly King exercises regularly to stay fit and carefully monitors his weight to ensure he remains in a healthy range.

Clips of his diet plan quickly went viral on social media, with fans raising concerns that the celebrity could be pushing himself too hard.

The 57-year-old stars and their family were not home at the time and nobody was hurt in the reported incident, a source told the Daily News.

TMZ was first to report the break-in, citing law enforcement sources saying someone broke a window to make their way into the residence. While it’s unclear whether anything was nabbed during the attempted robbery, sources said the suspect ran off when they heard a member of the household’s staff coming home.

No arrests have been made, though an investigation is underway, according to the outlet.

The reported burglary is the latest in a string of recent break-ins targeting celebrities’ Southern California digs.

Intruders smashed the glass door of Shang-Chi star Simu Liu’s home just ahead of New Year’s, though the actor wasn’t home at the time. The incident at Liu’s home occurred within days of burglaries at the homes of One Tree Hill alum Sophia Bush and jewelry designer Martin Katz.

TMZ reported at the time that a holiday gift was stolen from Bush’s home, while US$2.5mil worth of bags — including Hermès collector’s items — were reportedly taken from Katz’s. Two men were arrested for the latter burglary.

In August, burglars also smashed through the glass of Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson’s LA estate in broad daylight. Law enforcement sources at the time told TMZ the intruders didn’t get to the main house.

1561679,Nvidia unveils powerful AI system for genetic research,"SAN FRANCISCO: AI chipmaker Nvidia and research partners have created what they call the largest artificial intelligence system yet for biological research, the company said on Feb 19, aiming to speed up breakthroughs in medicine and genetics.

The new AI system, called Evo 2, can read and design genetic code across all forms of life.

Scientists have high hopes that such AI technology will dramatically accelerate research by spotting patterns in vast amounts of data that would normally take years to analyse by hand.

The system learned from nearly 9 trillion pieces of genetic information taken from over 128,000 different organisms, including bacteria, plants, and humans.

In early tests, it accurately identified 90% of potentially harmful mutations in BRCA1, a gene linked to breast cancer.

Scientists say this could help develop more precise treatments, including gene therapies that only target specific cells.

The model was built using 2,000 Nvidia H100 processors on Amazon's cloud infrastructure.

Developed with the Arc Institute and Stanford University, Evo 2 is now freely available to scientists worldwide through Nvidia's BioNeMo research platform.

""Designing new biology has traditionally been a laborious, unpredictable and artisanal process,"" said Brian Hie, assistant professor at Stanford University.

""With Evo 2, we make biological design of complex systems more accessible to researchers.""

Beyond medicine, researchers believe the technology could help create crops that better withstand climate change and develop new ways to break down pollution.

The project brings together Nvidia's computing power with the Arc Institute, a nonprofit research center founded in 2021 with US$650mil (RM2.87bil) in funding.

The institute works closely with Stanford, UC Berkeley, and UC San Francisco to tackle long-term scientific challenges. – AFP",Tech,AI,Complimentary,Short,,2025-02-20,"AI,Healthcare","AI chipmaker Nvidia and research partners have created what they call the largest artificial intelligence system yet for biological research, the company said on Feb 19, aiming to speed up breakthroughs in medicine and genetics.",https://www.thestar.com.my/tech/2025/02/20/nvidia-unveils-powerful-ai-system-for-genetic-research,https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/02/20/3176983.jpg,276

1561608,Impeachment trial vs VP Sara Duterte can start by March: Senate Minority leader,"MANILA: Senate Minority leader Aquilino Pimentel III believes the Senate can start acting on the impeachment proceeding against Vice President Sara Duterte as early as March.

Speaking to reporters in the “Kapihan sa Senado” forum on Thursday, Pimentel said Senate President Francis Escudero himself was “prepared” for the trial, noting that the rules had already been reviewed.

Asked when the impeachment trial should start, Pimentel immediately said in a mix of Filipino and English: “I hope in March… The SP [Senate president] has already prepared. He has asked for a review of the rules. That’s easy.”

“When the court goes in session, we will take the oath. We will affirm the existing rules so that there will be no issue on whether or not these are valid,” he went on.

“If we will propose amendments, then we will open. And then, we will authorise the Senate president to send summons to the impeached officials so that the 10 days will be in operation. It will be a pity if we will lose those days,” he added.

While Pimentel insisted that the trial should start by March, he also said that his use of the word ‘trial’ was a bit broad.

“My use of ‘trial’ is somewhat generic — meaning, the entire process,” he explained.

“Maybe witnesses would still not sit on the witness stand. It’s just that trial will start in a sense that the impeachment officials will be asked to answer. The prosecutors will be asked to respond.”

But does this mean that the Senate should have already convened into an impeachment court by March?

Pimentel said yes — so there would be no questions about the subsequent steps of the case. - Philippine Daily Inquirer/ANN",AseanPlus,Philippines,Complimentary,Short,,2025-02-20,"Philippines,Sara Duterte,impeachment,trial,Pimentel",Senate Minority leader Aquilino Pimentel III believes the Senate can start acting on the impeachment proceeding against Vice President Sara Duterte as early as March.,https://www.thestar.com.my/aseanplus/aseanplus-news/2025/02/20/impeachment-trial-vs-vp-sara-duterte-can-start-by-march-senate-minority-leader,https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/02/20/3176676.jpg,287

During the Minister’s Question Time in the Dewan Rakyat today, Finance Minister II Datuk Seri Amir Hamzah Azizan said the consortium’s offer to acquire all remaining MAHB shares at RM11 per share is aimed at positioning the company for a future relisting at a higher valuation. - Bernama",Business,Markets,Complimentary,Short,,2025-02-20,"Markets,MAHB,Delisting,GDA,CMSA, Amir Hamzah Azizan","KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (MAHB) is scheduled to be delisted from Bursa Malaysia on Feb 25, 2025.",https://www.thestar.com.my/business/2025/02/20/mahb-to-be-delisted-from-bursa-malaysia-on-feb-25,https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/02/20/3176678.jpg,181
1561598,Yen climbs to strongest this year versus dollar on BOJ hike bets,"TOKYO: The yen hit its strongest level against the dollar since December, beating all major currencies’ performance on Thursday (Feb 20) amid growing speculation the Bank of Japan (BOJ) will hike rates sooner rather than later.

Japan’s currency climbed as much as 0.8 per cent to 150.21 against the dollar, a level it hasn’t touched since Dec. 9. Government bond yields are also on the rise, with the 10-year benchmark hitting its highest level since 2009. Overnight index swaps are pricing in an 83 per cent chance of a rate hike by the central bank’s July meeting, compared with about 70 per cent odds at the start of this month, with a hike now seen as certain by September.

The central bank’s governor Kazuo Ueda said on Thursday that he did not discuss rising yields in a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. BOJ Board Member Hajime Takata also said on Wednesday that it’s important to continue considering gradual rate hikes, while also noting that Japan’s bond yields are moving in line with the market’s view of the economy.

""It’s significant that Takata didn’t express any concern about rising yields,” said Yujiro Goto, head of FX strategy at Nomura Securities Co., in a note. That leaves room for further rises in JGB yields and the yen, he said.

Japan’s recent data has also supported the BOJ’s case for raising rates, with gross domestic product outperforming forecasts and nominal wages jumping by the fastest pace in nearly three decades. - Bloomberg",AseanPlus,Japan,Complimentary,Short,,2025-02-20,"Japan,yen,US dollar,Bank of Japan,hike","TOKYO: The yen hit its strongest level against the dollar since December, beating all major currencies' performance on Thursday (Feb 20) amid growing speculation the Bank of Japan (BOJ) will hike rates sooner rather than later.",https://www.thestar.com.my/aseanplus/aseanplus-news/2025/02/20/yen-climbs-to-strongest-this-year-versus-dollar-on-boj-hike-bets,https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/02/20/3176643.jpg,251

Datu Anif-Dania, who are both 17, proved their talent when they captured the mixed doubles title in the National Under-18 Championships last May.

The pair were then selected for the Asian and World Junior Championships and reached the last eight in both tourneys.

Dania also showed her versatility when she captured silver in the girls’ doubles in the world meet with Low Zi Yu.

The duo also toppled several senior pairs to win gold in the Malaysia Games (Sukma) last August.

Dania and Anif are both thrilled to join BAM and aim to justify their selection.

“I received the offer letter from BAM last December. I’m excited to get to train with senior players and learn from them,” said Dania, who hails from Johor.

“I hope to improve my ranking to play in senior tournaments as soon as possible.

“I never expected to win silver in the World Juniors with Zi Yu as it was our first time playing in an international tournament.

‘‘We were very happy to reach the final.”

Anif, who is from Sabah, said: “Training in BAM so far has been tough but we need to work hard and go through this process to succeed.

“My aim this year is to win gold in both the World and Asian Junior meets.”

Last year's champions will face either Bayer Leverkusen or city rivals Atletico Madrid, depending on Friday's draw, as they seek a record-extending 16th title.

Mbappe opened the scoring with Real's first attack in the fourth minute, taking advantage of another massive blunder by City's defence when captain Ruben Dias missed his header and left the French forward free to lob over the onrushing Ederson.

Mbappe scored again in the 33rd minute with a close-range strike after a humiliating cutback that left defender Josko Gvardiol on the floor.

Real kept piling on the pressure and wasting chances against Pep Guardiola's struggling team. Mbappe scored his third in the 61st minute with a left-footed strike from the edge of the box just inside Ederson's right post.

Manchester City scored a compensation goal at the death, Nico Gonzalez converting a rebound after Omar Marmoush's free kick bounced off the crossbar, but it did little to tarnish a fantastic night for the Spaniards.

The 23-year-old completed the course in 47 minutes and 58.1 seconds, 52.4 seconds ahead of Tommaso Giacomel of Italy, who took silver, with Quentin Fillon Maillet securing the bronze for France, just under two minutes behind the winner.

The brilliant run of form that had Norwegian Johannes Thingnes Boe win the first two individual gold medals at the championships came to an abrupt halt after three misses at the first shoot, causing him to finish well outside the top 10.

Warm weather and bright sunshine in Lenzerheide, Switzerland greeted the 97 participants as they set off on the course at 30-second intervals, but with each missed shot adding a minute to their time, the athletes had to be wary of the tricky gusts of wind that caused them problems on the shooting range.

Local favourites Niklas Hartweg and Sebastian Stalder at one point were first and second after crossing the line, but with the stronger contenders all starting in the middle of the field, the two Swiss racers were eventually edged off the podium.

Perrot, whose sole miss came on the second shoot, found his groove in the middle of the race, speeding around the course and hitting his final 10 shots to heap the pressure on his rivals.

Italy's Giacomel responded best as he battled to keep pace with the Frenchman's skiing, but a miss on the 19th of his 20 shots in the competition and the ensuing one-minute penalty dashed his hopes of a gold medal.

1561110,Empowering people for the ocean,"THE Ocean Community Empowerment and Nature (Ocean) Grants Programme supported by the British Government has been awarded for conservation efforts in Sabah.

With the grant, Reef Check Malaysia (RCM) will implement a project that builds on its ongoing efforts to empower local communities on Pulau Larapan, off Semporna, to actively participate in sustainable marine resource management.

The project is set to run until 2027, according to RCM’s media statement.

Acting British High Commissioner to Malaysia David Wallace said the UK was committed to supporting work with local communities to protect its marine biodiversity.

“Over the years, the UK has supported efforts to protect Sabah’s forests, improve energy access and reduce poverty.

“I am delighted that this project with the Pulau Larapan community has been successful in securing funding from our Ocean programme.”

The project aims to establish a community protocol on Pulau Larapan and will be working with non-governmental organisation Green Semporna.

This initiative empowers indigenous peoples and local communities to take an active role in managing their resources, protecting cultural and traditional practices and securing customary rights to marine areas surrounding the island.

It will also be the island’s first marine-based community protocol.

Nurasikin Jajim from Green Semporna said, “For years, we have worked alongside local communities to promote sustainable marine conservation in Semporna.

1562071,Quantum computing stocks rise as Microsoft's new chip heats up debate over technology,"Quantum computing stocks advanced on Thursday after Microsoft launched a new chip that indicated the technology is not ""decades away"" as stated by the top boss of AI chip bellwether Nvidia.

Microsoft unveiled its Majorana 1 chip on Wednesday and said it is less prone to errors than rivals, while providing evidence in a scientific paper set to be published in academic journal Nature.

Quantum computing holds the promise of carrying out calculations that would take today's systems millions of years. If successful the technology could also potentially disrupt today's cybersecurity systems.

Shares ofIonQ gained 2.1%, Rigetti Computing rose 6.9% and D-Wave Quantum advanced 11.1%, while those of smaller peers Quantum Corp added 2.6% and Quantum Computing climbed 4.5%.

Shares of Microsoft edged up 0.5%, while Nvidia inched up 0.3%.

When quantum computers will arrive has become a topic of debate in the upper echelons of the tech industry. Microsoft along with Alphabet and IBM are in a growing camp of companies that believe the technology's practical use is nearer than previously imagined.

Quantum computing stocks took a hit in early January when Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the technology was two decades away from overtaking his company's chips, which are the workhorses of artificial intelligence.

The stocks logged monthly losses in January, ending a year-long rally that saw them outperform the tech-focused Nasdaq, as well as Nvidia and Microsoft.

They have lost between 18% and 70% so far this year, compared with last year when they had risen at least three-fold.

1561877,"TikTok restructures trust and safety team, lays off staff in unit, sources say","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - TikTok is laying off global staff at its trust and safety unit which handles content moderation as part of a restructuring, three sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday.

Two sources said that Adam Presser, operations head of the app who also oversees the unit, sent a memo out to staff on Thursday notifying them of the move.

The layoffs began the same day for teams in Asia and Europe, Middle East and Africa, two of the sources said.

TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The move comes as TikTok's fate remains up in the air. The popular short video app used by nearly half of all Americans went dark briefly last month, before a law took effect on January 19 that required its Chinese owner ByteDance either to sell it on national security grounds or face a ban.

In January last year, TikTok Shou Chew testified before Congress alongside Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg and other tech and media heads in a hearing where lawmakers accused the companies of failing to protect children from escalating threats of sexual predation on their platforms.

Replying to questions from Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, TikTok's CEO had said that the company would spend more than $2 billion on trust and safety efforts.

In October last year, the company laid off hundreds of employees from its global workforce, including a large number of staff in Malaysia as it shifts focus towards a greater use of AI in content moderation.

TikTok says it has 40,000 trust and safety professionals worldwide. Reuters was not able to immediately establish the extent of these cuts.

Hasto Kristiyanto, secretary general of the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, known as PDIP, was arrested on charges of bribing an election official to install his preferred politician in a parliamentary seat in 2019, and obstruction of justice, Setyo Budiyanto said at a press conference.

The obstruction of justice involved Hasto allegedly instructing the concerned politician, Harun Masiku, to escape agency investigators and to submerge his phone in water, Setyo said. Masiku remains a fugitive.

Hasto and the party, which is headed by former President Megawati Sukarnoputri, have repeatedly denied wrongdoing, alleging the investigation was politically motivated.

Hasto's lawyer Ronny Talapessy told Reuters after the arrest that his client was being ""targeted,"" without elaborating.

The anti-corruption agency chief on Thursday denied that the case was politically motivated.

The agency first revealed the investigation in 2020, and three people have already been sentenced for their roles, while a fourth has absconded.

Hasto was named as a suspect in December 2024.

PDIP is the country's largest political party, but the only one that sits outside of President Prabowo Subianto's ruling coalition in parliament.

1561372,Ringgit rises as markets digest Fed minutes,"KUALA LUMPUR: The ringgit rose against the US dollar in early trade after the release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting minutes, an analyst said.

At 8 am, the ringgit strengthened to 4.4400/4500 from 4.4410/4450 at Wednesday’s close.

Bank Muamalat Malaysia Bhd chief economist Dr Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid said the minutes showed the US Federal Reserve remained unconvinced that inflation was sustainably moving towards its two per cent target, despite the labour market remaining near full employment.

""This says that they need more evidence before they can cut rates, and the prevailing Federal Funds Rate ought to stay to keep the risk of higher inflation at bay,” he told Bernama today.

Mohd Afzanizam said the meeting minutes also supported the US dollar index (DXY), which rose from 106.880 in early US trading to 107.171 overnight.

He noted that futures markets now indicate just one rate cut this year, down from the previously expected two.

""This implies that the markets have begun accepting the fact that the Fed is keen to maintain its restrictive monetary policy stance.

""As such, the ringgit could stay soft and possibly continue to flirt around its immediate resistance level of RM4.45,” he added.

Meanwhile, the ringgit traded mostly higher against major currencies.

1561169,Tycoon Gupta’s steelworks ops forced into administration,"SYDNEY: A steelworks project owned by Indian tycoon Sanjeev Gupta has been ordered into administration by the South Australia government after his GFG Alliance failed to pay royalties.

The South Australian government “has been in receipt of advice from our steel taskforce that the owner of the steelworks’ financial position wasn’t just deteriorating, it was likely to continue deteriorating”, the state’s premier, Peter Malinauskas, told reporters in Adelaide yesterday.

GFG Alliance has struggled to turn a profit at the project since company chairman Gupta first acquired it from bankruptcy in 2017. The Whyalla steelworks encountered a number of unplanned shutdowns for maintenance last year. Local media have reported issues with payments to contractors.

The steelworks has an annual production capacity of 1.2 million tonnes, using a blast-furnace process.

Malinauskas said he wasn’t at liberty to disclose the exact amount of royalties owed, but it was in the tens of millions of dollars. The premier added he was confident the project had a viable long-term future under a new owner.

GFG Alliance is a sprawling group of businesses that employs roughly 30,000 people in 30 countries.

In recent years, a number of Gupta’s companies have been shuttering production, failing to pay suppliers and staff, and falling into insolvency.

Last week, a lawyer representing GFG Alliance in a London court said the company was close to reaching a “global settlement” with the lenders, including UBS Group AG, on about £289mil (US$365mil) of debt.

GFG’s financial position “was compromising the very operations of the steelworks itself”, Malinauskas said.

Its Minister, Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz said the ministry will review the matter, particularly concerning the electric vehicle assembly hub in Tanjung Malim, Perak.

""The planning appears to be long-term, with significant costs to be borne by Proton and Geely.

""At the same time, we will ensure that jobs in engineering, installation, maintenance, and management during the first phase of this factory involve local vendors and Malaysians, especially those with a keen interest in the automotive industry,"" he said during the winding-up session of the Royal Address debate for the ministry in the Dewan Rakyat today.

Tengku Zafrul noted that the supply chain issue had previously been discussed with Proton, particularly regarding the challenges faced by local vendors competing with Chinese companies.

""(We have discussed) bringing factories from China directly to Malaysia. However, this would put pressure on our local manufacturers and vendors, as they may struggle to compete with Chinese firms in terms of economic scale and expertise.

""Therefore, the special incentives provided must ensure that the supply chain originates from within our country. Otherwise, these incentives cannot be granted,"" he said.

On Tesla's investment in Malaysia, Tengku Zafrul said the company's decision to establish a factory in the country is still under discussion.

""Several Southeast Asia countries are also courting Tesla. Currently, Tesla operates only one factory in Asia, located in China.

At 6 pm, the ringgit strengthened to an almost two-week high of 4.4270/4320 from 4.4410/4450 at Wednesday’s close.

Bank Muamalat Malaysia Bhd chief economist Dr Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid interprets this development as a sign of a less hawkish stance, suggesting that Trump may take a less aggressive approach towards trade relations with China.

“We must not overlook the fact that managing a family should be a shared responsibility between husband and wife.

“The willingness of husbands to set aside their ego of ‘only men need to be the breadwinners’ and embrace this caregiving task indicates an attitude of togetherness, understanding, and respect between husband and wife,” she said, adding that this value is aligned with the National Family Policy.

Nancy made this statement during her ministerial winding-up speech for the motion of thanks for the royal address, addressing Paya Besar MP Datuk Shahar Abdullah’s inquiry about government measures to tackle the increasing trend of wives working whilst their husbands stay at home as caregivers for ageing parents or in-laws.

Shahar and Kapar MP Dr Halimah Ali proposed encouraging more companies to adopt family-friendly policies to promote work-life balance.

They cautioned that an imbalance could influence mental health, potentially impacting birth rates and national fertility levels.

“When duties are evenly distributed, families operate more fairly and efficiently, particularly benefitting working women.

“The government, through various ministries and agencies, is committed to ensuring family-oriented policies remain relevant to socio-economic development,” said Nancy.

1562075,200 fraud suspects repatriated from Myanmar to China,"NANJING, (Bernama-Xinhua): A group of 200 Chinese citizens suspected of involvement in fraud were escorted back to China by Chinese police on Thursday (Feb 20) after being repatriated from Myawaddy, Myanmar, Xinhua reported.

The suspects were first sent to Thailand's Mae Sot, which shares a border with Myawaddy, on Thursday, before being flown back to China on several chartered flights.

They arrived at an airport in Nanjing, the capital of eastern Jiangsu Province.

The 200 Chinese citizens are the first group of telecom fraud suspects repatriated from Myanmar to China, according to the Ministry of Public Security.

It added that more than 800 other Chinese fraud suspects are expected to be repatriated in the coming period.

The repatriation of these suspects marks a significant achievement of law enforcement cooperation between China, Myanmar and Thailand against telecom fraud, the ministry said.

According to the ministry, law enforcement authorities from the three countries recently launched a joint telecom fraud operation in Myawaddy.

In coordination with this effort, Thailand has cut off electricity, Internet and fuel supplies to Myawaddy, and strengthened patrols to prevent illegal border crossings by individuals involved in fraud.

Myanmar has deployed forces to raid telecom fraud compounds in Myawaddy, arrested fraud suspects, and rescued Chinese nationals trapped in scam operations.

An official with the ministry said the three countries would institutionalise joint operations to combat telecom fraud and other transnational crimes on a regular basis.

The ministry also vowed to continue to dismantle telecom fraud compounds and effectively safeguard the lives and property of Chinese citizens. - Bernama-Xinhua",AseanPlus,Myanmar,Complimentary,Short,,2025-02-20,"Myanmar,200 fraud suspects,repatriated,China,Myawaddy,","NANJING, (China): (Bernama-Xinhua) A group of 200 Chinese citizens suspected of involvement in fraud were escorted back to China by Chinese police on Thursday (Feb 20) after being repatriated from Myawaddy, Myanmar, Xinhua reported.",https://www.thestar.com.my/aseanplus/aseanplus-news/2025/02/20/200-fraud-suspects-repatriated-from-myanmar-to-china,https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/02/20/3177653.jpg,259

She had seen the reptile from a bridge connecting the two locations, and said that this was a small upgrade from the usual monitor lizards found in the water.

Some social media users have responded to the sighting with humour, including one that said the crocodile had travelled to KL to uplift spirits.

Meanwhile another user said they would drop by the area on the weekend, because seeing the reptile reminded them of their home in Sarawak.

At about 6pm, another user on X said that officers from the National Parks Department were seen on-site, alongside those from the Kuala Lumpur City Hall - the city council which administers the Malaysian capital - as well as Malaysia’s Civil Defence Department.

Videos posted on Facebook by Malaysian news outlets showed the officers lowering a cage into the Klang River, in the hopes of capturing the crocodile.

Quoting Brickfields police chief Ku Mashariman Ku Mahmood, a locla daily reported that relevant agencies had been present since the afternoon.

1561188,Growth in domestic demand to uplift MR DIY,"PETALING JAYA: MR DIY Group (M) Bhd may deliver a strong compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) net profit until the financial year 2026 (FY26) despite any short-term concerns.

According to CGS International (CGSI) Research, earnings in the near term are seen to be dragged down by the issues faced by its automated warehouse and declining same store sales growth (SSSG).

But it still projects CAGR for the group’s earnings per share from FY23 to FY26 to grow by some 24%.

In the group’s third-quarter results briefing, MR DIY also stated that it intends to continue expanding its network and brand presence into Sabah and Sarawak, and the East Coast states of Peninsular Malaysia in the coming FY25.

This will help increase its revenue as new stores are opened, CGSI Research said.

“We think that fears of potentially weak fourth-quarter results have led to MR DIY’s share price falling 20% in the year-to-date period and 30% since the release of its third-quarter results on Nov 14,” it said.

An expected 6% growth in domestic demand this year may help prop up the earnings growth of the consumer discretionary sector, it said.

“We see key drivers of consumer sentiment and spending in 2025 from higher civil servant salaries from December 2024, minimum wage increases from February 2025 and higher monthly cash handouts to lower-income households,” CGSI Research said.

Also, the increased inbound and domestic tourism and any improved consumer sentiment from a strengthening ringgit could help further.

MR DIY’s shares at RM1.47 during yesterday’s trade were at 16.7 times the 2025 forward price-to-earnings ratio and this presents an attractive entry point, said the research house.

1561185,Analog Devices boosts buyback by US$10bil,"NEW YORK: Analog Devices Inc has increased its stock repurchase programme by US$10bil and has raised its dividend, moving to reward shareholders ahead of the chipmaker’s quarterly report.

The buyback plans will bring the total size of the programme to US$11.5bil, the company said in a statement on Tuesday. Its quarterly dividend, meanwhile, will grow 8% to 99 US cents a share.

Chief executive officer Vincent Roche pointed to the company’s policy of returning 100% of its free cash flow to shareholders over the long term.

“Over the 21 years of our capital return programme, we have paid dividends amounting to more than US$13bil and repurchased approximately US$16bil of our common stock,” he said.

1560378,M’sia’s strategic location ideal to attract new chip investments,"PETALING JAYA: The ongoing shift in the global supply semiconductor chain as a result of Sino-US trade tensions can benefit Malaysia’s established semiconductor sector, provided there is support in the form of right policies and incentives to attract the investments flows.

RHB Research, in a research report, stated Malaysia’s strategic location in Asean and its well-developed free trade zones can further attract new semiconductor investments, as major sector players seek to derisk from China-based supply chains.

It added one of Malaysia’s key strengths was its cost competitiveness. Competitive wages for operators and technicians, coupled with low costs for power and water, make it an economically viable hub for semiconductor manufacturing.

Furthermore, the country’s well developed logistics infrastructure – encompassing road, rail, air and sea freight networks – ensures efficient supply chain management and global connectivity.

The scope to grow the sector is thus good.

Malaysia is now an established outsourced semiconductor assembly and testing services provider in the global supply chain through companies like Inari Amertron Bhd , Malaysian Pacific Industries Bhd, Unisem (M) Bhd and Globetronics Technology Bhd .

It also has a presence in the fabrication space through companies like Dagang Nexchange Bhd (Silterra) and X-FAB Sarawak.

RHB Research added the country’s proximity to Singapore enhanced its liveability and strategic positioning while the city state, which is a global semiconductor hub, provides opportunities for collaboration and talent mobility.

Bank Indonesia also left steady the overnight deposit facility and lending facility rates at 5.00% and 6.50%, respectively.

Governor Perry Warjiyo said BI will consider the rupiah exchange rate, inflation and economic growth prospects in assessing for the room for future interest rate cuts.

Wednesday's decision followed a rate cut in January that markets had not expected.

The central bank has said the need for stability in the rupiah is an important factor in its deliberations.

In a statement to Bursa Malaysia, Malaysian Pacific Industries Bhd said the demand will benefit the industry and offset the weaker demand from the automotive sector.

The group is involved in manufacturing services for semiconductor packaging and testing.

Previously, analysts said there would be a challenging near-term outlook for the auto semiconductor sector.

However, the group is set to remain optimistic about its financials this year.

“The board expects the performance for the financial year to be satisfactory,” it said in the statement.

For the second quarter ended Dec 31, 2024, the group posted a higher revenue of RM530.5mil compared to RM522.7mil in the same quarter a year ago.

The group said revenue was higher due to its Asian and European segments that were higher at 11% and 7% respectively.

However, revenue from the US was lower by 30% compared to the same quarter a year ago.

Net profit was recorded at RM40.03mil for the quarter under review compared to RM32.15mil a year ago on the back of lower operating costs.

The group’s board did not recommend any interim dividend for the quarter ended Dec 31, 2024, but for the financial year-to-date, it had declared a total single-tier dividend of 10 sen per share, amounting to RM19.9mil which has been paid out.",Business,Corporate News,Complimentary,Short,,2025-02-19,"Corporate News,MPI,Malaysian Pacific Industries","PETALING JAYA: Despite uncertainty in the semiconductor industry and possible impositions from US tariffs, the growing demand for artificial intelligence and data centres will continue.",https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2025/02/19/mpi-expects-ai-data-centre-demand-to-sustain-semiconductor-sector,https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/02/19/3175637.jpeg,237

In a filing with Bursa Malaysia, Duopharma said this would be achievable with a resolute focus on sustainable growth, cost optimisation and operational resilience.

For the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2024, Duopharma’s net profit rose to RM15.08mil from RM8.5mil in the previous corresponding period, while revenue grew to RM193.67mil from RM167.50mil a year earlier.

Duopharma said the higher revenue was driven by robust sales across the public health, ethical specialty, and export segments, which offset the weaker-than-expected performance of the consumer healthcare sector.

“During the year, the group faced heightened operational costs, primarily driven by the full-scale operation of the newly completed K3 facility, increased finance costs and the impact of higher electricity tariffs and the amendments to the Employment Act 1955 introduced last year.

Ademola Lookman pulled one goal back for Atalanta but then had a penalty saved by veteran goalkeeper Simon Mignolet, who made several other important stops to stymie home hopes and see the Belgian side advance to the last 16 5-2 on aggregate.

Atalanta’s elimination added to a calamitous night for Italian football, following AC Milan’s exit earlier when they were held to a 1-1 draw by visitors Feyenoord of the Netherlands and went out of the Champions League 2-1 on aggregate.

The MyCIF is a co-investment fund established by the Finance Ministry under Budget 2019 to co-invest in MSMEs through equity crowdfunding (ECF) and peer-to-peer (P2P) financing platforms.

Securities Commission Digital Strategy and Innovation executive director Dr Wong Huei Ching highlighted that only 17% of ECF and P2P-funded businesses are from the northern region, emphasising a significant gap in awareness.

“This percentage is low. That is why we are organising roadshows in collaboration with the Northern Corridor Implementation Authority (NCIA) to raise awareness and encourage MSMEs to seize the opportunity to strengthen their businesses through MyCIF’s alternative financing channels,” she told reporters at the MyCIF@Northern Region Roadshow yesterday.

Wong said the northern region, which accounts for 20% of Malaysia’s MSMEs, was chosen for the roadshow due to its importance in driving economic growth.

She stressed the importance of expanding the MyCIF roadshow nationwide, ensuring that businesses across Malaysia have equal access to powerful alternative-financing options.

“Today’s sessions are designed to educate attendees about ECF and P2P financing, equipping them with the knowledge, tools and connections needed to access the funding options,” said Wong.

With seed funding of RM260mil, MyCIF has co-invested more than RM1bil in over 9,000 MSMEs, helping businesses access funding through ECF and P2P financing.

U.S. President Donald Trump's administration deported the migrants on three flights, part of his crackdown on unlawful migration.

The 299 migrants have been staying at a hotel in Panama City under the protection of local authorities and with the financial support of the United States through the International Organization for Migration and the U.N. refugee agency, Security Minister Frank Abrego said.

""Today I can tell you that 171 of the (migrants) have accepted to return voluntarily,"" said Abrego, adding that the others will leave gradually when the U.N. provides them with their return transportation.

In the interim, those migrants will likely be transferred to a shelter near the Darien Gap jungle in southern Panama that connects Central America with South America.

After talks with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio this month, Panama's President Jose Raul Mulino announced that a deal signed in July with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security could be expanded so that Venezuelan, Colombian and Ecuadorean migrants could also be repatriated from Panama.

Rental companies such as Airbnb increasingly use self check-in keyboxes to save time for property owners and holidaymakers, who no longer need to meet to hand over keys and complete check-in procedures.

However, critics say the boxes are ugly and argue that check-ins without a physical encounter between guest and renter pose a security risk.

""Next week we will go ... to check where the ban on keyboxes is not respected, and then we will remove them,"" Florence Mayor Sara Funaro told a local television channel on Wednesday.

Fines of up to 400 euros ($417.20) will be imposed on non-compliant owners, according to the city council's decision.

Other famed Italian tourist destinations such as Rome and Venice have also taken steps to rein in tourist numbers as locals protest against the lack of affordable accommodation and hoteliers say holiday lets are hitting their business.

Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's government has already issued a nationwide rule prohibiting check-ins without visual guest identification.

Massimo Torelli, spokesperson for the ""Let's save Florence to live in it"" campaign, said the group had been daubing the check-in boxes with a red cross.

They are ""everywhere, on the bicycle racks and on the street-light poles ... Florence is dying of uncontrolled tourism,"" he said.

Torelli said he was pleased that city hall was finally taking action and he hoped the number of apartments dedicated to short-stay visitors would drop from 15,000 at present to 7,000-8,000, freeing up accommodation for local residents.

1560388,Frontken counting on US acquisition to lift earnings next year,"PETALING JAYA: Mechanical engineering and semicondutor-services company Frontken Corp Bhd is expected to see earnings growth upon completion of its acquisition of a US-based company this year.

Maybank Investment Bank (Maybank IB Research) said it expects the deal to be fully funded internally due to the company’s healthy net cash balances of RM367mil as of the end of the third quarter 2024 (3Q24).

“Assuming the acquisition is completed by the end of 1Q25 for about US$50mil, or a multiple of about 10 to 12 times price-earnings and the company’s target earnings for last year are replicated from this year to 2026, the acquisition will likely lift Frontken Corp’s earnings by 7% to 9%, and 8% to 10% this year and next year, respectively,” the research house added.

Maybank IB Research said. during Frontken’s last analyst briefing in October 2024, the company’s management had disclosed that it was exploring the acquisition of 100% equity interest in an as yet unnamed US-based company for about US$40 to US$50mil (about RM177mil to RM221mil).

Frontken Corp specialises in engineering and precision cleaning services, mostly for the semiconductor and oil and gas markets in Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia.

In terms of downside risks for the company, research house said, for now, they are relatively contained.

“Although we do not rule out downside risks to front-end volume loading in Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia from a turbulent macro climate due to US tariff threats, high inflation, weak global aggregate demand, we believe a marginal shortfall will likely be mitigated by a successful value-accretive acquisition.

1560556,Australian billionaire Palmer launches Trump-inspired political party,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian billionaire Clive Palmer launched on Wednesday a political party he said was directly inspired by U.S. President Donald Trump, months out from a nationwide federal election.

Mining magnate Palmer said his Trumpet of Patriots party would ""drain the swamp"" in the country's capital Canberra, a reference to Trump's plans to drastically cut the size of government.

""We think Donald Trump's been very effective in reducing public expenditure,"" Palmer told a news conference announcing the launch.

Palmer was critical of mass immigration and said the party would only recognise two genders, reflecting positions also favoured by Trump.

Trumpet of Patriots plans to stand candidates in all 150 seats in Australia's lower house, as well as the upper chamber, known as the Senate, Palmer said.

Palmer, Australia's 18th richest person with a net worth of $2.1 billion according to Forbes, previously led the right-wing United Australia Party (UAP), sitting as a lawmaker in the lower house for three years from 2013.

Palmer spent around A$100 million ($63.52 million) on campaigning for the UAP in the last federal election, yielding a single Senator in the upper house.

He failed to register UAP in time for this year's election, that must be held by May.

Prime Minster Anthony Albanese is yet to announce the date of the poll, that could be as early as March after the country's central bank cut interest rates on Tuesday, a boost for the government that has seen its popularity fall due to cost of living pressures.

1561105,Analog Devices beats first-quarter revenue estimates as chip demand recovers,"(Reuters) - Analog Devices topped first-quarter Wall Street expectations for revenue and profit on Wednesday, driven by a recovery in chip demand, particularly in the consumer segment, sending its shares up 4%.

The company provides semiconductors to a variety of industries including aerospace, automotive, communications, digital healthcare and industrial automation.

Wilmington, Massachusetts-based Analog Devices' consumer segment revenue rose 19% to $322.9 million from a year earlier.

The rise in sales was driven by demand for consumer electronics on the back of adoption of AI-driven devices, premium smartphones and smart home products.

The company's first-quarter revenue stood at $2.4 billion, beating analysts' estimate of $2.36 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.

Bookings continued to show gradual improvement during the first quarter with strength in industrial and automotive, positioning the company to grow in the second quarter, Chief Executive Vincent Roche said in a statement.

The company is positioned to benefit from automation growth, including robotics and smart instruments, while the rising adoption of hybrid and electric vehicles is also expected to drive demand for analog chips, said Logan Purk, tech analyst at Edward Jones.

The company expects second-quarter revenue of $2.50 billion, plus or minus $100 million, compared to estimates of $2.46 billion.

The chipmaker expects adjusted earnings per share of $1.68, plus or minus 10 cents, in the current quarter, compared with estimates of $1.66.

1560483,This system lets drones accurately track their location indoors for autonomous flight,"American engineers have developed a new system that simplifies the autonomous navigation of drones in an indoor environment, with or without light. There could be multiple uses for this technology, from handling goods in warehouses to first aid operations.

Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have developed a new system capable of accurately tracking the position of a drone in indoor environments, even in darkness or low visibility conditions. The invention, called MiFly, uses cross-polarised radars and wireless beacons to enable the drone to track its position autonomously.

A cross-polarised radar emits electromagnetic waves and analyses their signal reflected by beacons previously installed on the walls. By interpreting these signals, the drone can accurately determine its position in six dimensions, regardless of visibility. A drone must be able to position itself and orient itself accurately on these six axes if it is to one day fly completely autonomously. The researchers have so far conducted hundreds of flight experiments and found that MiFly systematically locates the drone with an accuracy of less than seven centimeters.

Unlike outdoor drones that rely on GPS, this solution could provide an alternative to conventional indoor navigation systems, such as computer vision (analysis of the environment via cameras and AI algorithms) or LiDAR (3D mapping by laser beams), which are often limited by low light levels.

This is a major step towards autonomous navigation in the future and the uses that could come with it, whether in the automated management of warehouse stock or for possible search and rescue missions in confined or poorly lit environments. – AFP Relaxnews",Tech,Drones,Complimentary,Short,,2025-02-19,"Drones,Driverless vehicle,Technology","American engineers have developed a new system that simplifies the autonomous navigation of drones in an indoor environment, with or without light.

""We will go on the offensive from this year,"" Hidehito Takahashi told Reuters in an interview.

Resonac was formed by Showa Denko's acquisition of the larger Hitachi Chemical and has been selling assets with a partial spin-off of its petrochemical business planned.

Photoresist maker JSR has said it wants to drive consolidation in the industry and was taken private by a state-backed fund last year.

""It's a fund so there will be an exit in the end,"" said Takahashi, adding he wants to be involved in that exit.

Japan has many leading makers of semiconductor materials and equipment which have survived decades of competition even as the country has lost its prominent position in chip manufacturing.

The market for individual materials is limited and companies need scale for capital investment and research and development, Takahashi said.

Resonac is setting up an R&D centre for advanced semiconductor packaging and materials in Silicon Valley to deepen collaboration with firms there.

The company is not currently considering manufacturing materials in the United States, Takahashi said.

If there was a big increase in demand from customers in the U.S., Takahashi said Resonac would consider factors including potential subsidies and tariffs.

Musk bought X, formerly Twitter, for the same price in 2022, but some investors including Fidelity Investments have sharply written down the value of their stake as the platform struggled to retain advertisers after the takeover.

X did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. The reported talks come as valuations of Musk's other companies soared after the victory of Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential race.

Tesla shares have surged more than 40% since Trump's victory, while SpaceX was valued at $350 billion in December. Musk's AI startup, xAI, is also in talks to raise $10 billion at a $75 billion valuation, up from $40 billion, according to reports.

Musk's close ties with Trump and return of some advertisers to X have lifted expectations of better finances at the platform. That has helped banks offload the debt they issued to support Musk's Twitter buyout, a source told Reuters earlier this month.

Banks, led by Morgan Stanley, sold another chunky portion of loans that formed the $13 billion debt supporting Musk's acquisition, as the deal found broad interest from large fund managers attracted by the prospect of improving revenue of X.

Talks for the new X financing round were still on and the details could change, the Bloomberg News report said, adding that this would be the first known investment round for the social media company since Musk took it private.

Authorities blame Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, for Nigeria's currency woes and detained two of its executives in 2024 after cryptocurrency websites emerged as platforms of choice for trading the local naira currency.

Binance, which is not registered in Nigeria, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It has previously said it is working with Nigeria's Federal Inland Revenue Service to resolve potential historic tax liabilities.

The inland revenue service alleges in documents seen by Reuters that Binance has a ""significant economic presence"" in Nigeria and is therefore liable for corporate income tax. It is seeking a court declaration that Binance pay income taxes for 2022 and 2023, plus a 10% annual penalty on unpaid amounts.

The FIRS is also requesting a 26.75% interest rate on the unpaid taxes, based on the Central Bank of Nigeria's lending rate.

Binance was already facing four counts of tax evasion in Nigeria after a government crackdown on the industry last year.

The charges include non-payment of value-added tax, company income tax, failure to file tax returns, and complicity in helping customers to evade taxes through its platform.

Binance, which is contesting the charges, announced in March last year that it was stopping all transactions and trading in the naira.

The company is also facing separate money laundering charges by Nigeria's anti-graft agency, which it has denied.

Sticky inflation and competition from other online shopping platforms such as Amazon.com and PDD Holdings' Temu have hurt Etsy's revenue as consumers opted for lower prices and discounts.

While consumer spending grew in the last three months of the year, according to the U.S. Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis, demand for products such as furniture and accessories was weak as people prioritized essentials.

Garmin makes wearables designed for a niche market of professionals and specializes in GPS-enabled products for defense and recreational needs, charging a premium for its high-end, specialized products.

Its strong and specialized business advantage has helped it fend off competition from smartphone makers like Apple and Samsung, which have launched wearables in the high-end market — that Garmin currently dominates — with the launch of the Apple Watch Ultra and Galaxy Watch Ultra wearables, respectively.

For the full-year 2025, Garmin expects revenue of approximately $6.80 billion, above analysts' estimate of $6.72 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.

On a pro forma basis, it expects to report a full-year adjusted profit of $7.80 per share, beating an estimate of $7.74 per share.

Garmin's outdoor segment, its largest by revenue, saw strong demand for its adventure watches in the holiday-season quarter, reporting quarterly revenues of $629.4 million, trouncing an estimate of $585.6 million.

Revenue from its auto OEM segment jumped 30% to $165.8 million, led by increased shipments of domain controllers to automakers such as BMW.

For the quarter ended December 31, Garmin reported revenues of $1.82 billion, above analysts' estimate of $1.7 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.

On a pro forma basis, its profit was $2.41 per share, while analysts expected a profit of $2.03 per share.

Messaging platform WhatsApp in a February 14 filing said it had about 46.8 million average monthly active users in the 27-country European Union in the six month period to December 2024, above the 45-million-user threshold set out in the Digital Services Act (DSA).

""We can indeed confirm that WhatsApp has published user numbers above the threshold for designation as a Very Large Online Platform under the Digital Services Act,"" European Commission spokesperson Thomas Regnier said in an email on Wednesday.

After receiving the designation, a platform has four months to comply with the DSA requirements including identifying and assessing system risks related to illegal content, fundamental rights, public security and protection of minors.

Fines for DSA violations can reach as much as 6% of a company's global annual revenue. Meta's Instagram and Facebook are already classified as very large online platforms.

Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg and its chief lobbyist Joel Kaplan have criticised EU tech rules and enlisted the support of U.S. President Donald Trump.

1560999,"Large sinkhole appears in English village, forces evacuations","GODSTONE, England (Reuters) - A large sinkhole has appeared in a southern English village, swallowing up at least one garden and forcing authorities to evacuate residents from around 30 homes.

The development of the sinkhole in the Surrey village of Godstone, which appeared on Monday and had grown to at least 20 metres on Tuesday, has been declared a major incident by local agencies.

The BBC said the evacuated properties were built about three years ago, on the site of a former sand quarry. One of the residents, Noosh Miri, said her family was among those evacuated.

""We got a violent knocking on the door,"" Miri said. ""As I opened the door, it sounded like I was in a waterfall because the sinkhole was right in front of my doorstep.""

Another resident, Rez Mira, told the BBC his garden fell into the sinkhole: ""It's collapsed, the wall will come down, for sure... we're terrified.""

Surrey County Council (SCC) said investigations were ongoing, and asked people to avoid the area while work was carried out. Residents from within the cordon were being supported with advice around accommodation, the council said.

""The Local Resilience Forum will continue to meet throughout this incident to ensure everything is being done to resolve the situation as quickly and safely as possible,"" said SCC's Carl Bussey.

SES Water said in the early hours of Tuesday it was aware of a burst water main pipe in Godstone High Street. It said on Wednesday it had been able to restore supplies to affected properties. Electricity has also been restored.

The Belgian side held a 2-1 advantage going into the second leg and romped to a 3-0 half-time lead in Italy to put the game beyond last season's Europa League winners.

Atalanta pulled a goal back 35 seconds into the second half but were unable to narrow the deficit further, with Ademola Lookman having a penalty saved by Simon Mignolet on the hour mark.

“We conceded that goal very quickly. Then we were lucky that Simon saved that penalty. We had to survive,” said Brugge coach Hayen.

“We knew in advance that the match would turn out like that and we could not put together any attacks. But I’m not going to blame my players. They all put their heads down and everyone did his part.”

Brugge were ahead after three minutes through teenager Chemsdine Talbi and he added a second midway through the half before Ferran Jutgla made it 3-0.

“It doesn't surprise me. We have so much quality,” Hayen added.

“If you play football with courage and confidence, you can get chances. So I didn't have to pinch myself.”

Brugge will meet either Aston Villa or Lille in the last 16.

1560471,Rugby-Cheika meets with Rugby Australia amid Wallabies coaching speculation,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Michael Cheika met with Rugby Australia CEO Phil Waugh on Tuesday, raising speculation the former Australia boss is among candidates to succeed Joe Schmidt at the helm of the Wallabies.

Cheika, who coached the Wallabies in 68 tests from 2014-19, met Waugh at a Sydney restaurant, Australian media reported.

Rugby Australia (RA) declined to comment on the meeting but Waugh said in a statement that the governing body had made a targeted shortlist and received a high level of interest from ""quality candidates around the world"".

Schmidt will end his reign as Wallabies coach in October after this year's Rugby Championship, dashing local hopes the highly-regarded New Zealander would stay on until the 2027 World Cup.

Cheika is currently coach of Leicester Tigers but will exit the English club at the end of the season.

The 57-year-old coached Australia to the 2015 World Cup final in England but left the post in acrimony after the Wallabies crashed out of the 2019 quarter-finals in Japan.

Cheika later took over as Argentina head coach and left the role after guiding the Pumas to the 2023 World Cup semi-finals.

RA hopes to confirm Schmidt's successor in coming weeks.

The new Wallabies coach's first job will be preparing the squad for a season-ending northern hemisphere tour starting in Tokyo against Eddie Jones's Japan on Oct. 25.

Australia will then meet England at Twickenham on November 1 followed by tests against Italy, Ireland and France, RA confirmed on Wednesday.

The 39-year-old actor, whose real name is Uhm Hong-sik, began serving a one-year prison term in September 2024 after being convicted by the Seoul Central District Court for the habitual use of medical propofol and other drugs. The court also imposed a fine of 2 million won and a forfeiture of 1.45 million won.

In the appeal trial on Feb 18, the Seoul High Court suspended his prison sentence for two years, while upholding the fine and forfeiture.“It appears that Yoo committed the offense despite the risks of excessive drug use as he struggled with depression. He has vowed not to re-offend and has spent over five months in detention,” the court said in a statement.

Regarding the reason for suspending the jail term, the court said: “We took into account his lack of a criminal history for similar offences and the fact that he has not received criminal penalties beyond the fine as favourable factors.”

1560891,US envoy Kellogg arrives in Ukraine for talks with Zelenskiy,"KYIV (Reuters) - Keith Kellogg, U.S. President Donald Trump's Ukraine envoy, arrived in Kyiv on Wednesday to meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and ""listen,"" as the war against Russia approaches its three-year mark.

Kellogg's visit comes a day after the United States and Russia met in Riyadh for talks on ending the war, without Ukraine.

""It will give us a chance to have good substantial talks,"" Kellogg said, adding that the talks will build on weekend conversations at the Munich Security Conference.

""We understand the need for security guarantees,"" Kellogg told journalists, saying that part of his mission would be ""to sit and listen"".

Ukraine has repeatedly stressed the need for security guarantees from the U.S. that would deter Russia from launching a new invasion once a peace deal is reached.

Kellogg said he would share the findings with Trump and the rest of the team to ""ensure that we get this one right.""

Zelenskiy postponed a visit to Saudi Arabia planned for Wednesday in order not to give ""legitimacy"" to Tuesday's meeting between U.S. and Russian officials in Riyadh, two sources told Reuters earlier.

Trump dismissed Ukraine's concerns about being left out of U.S.-Russian talks on ending the Ukraine war, saying Kyiv could have made a deal with Russia earlier.

Lookman pulled back one goal early in the second half after Brugge took a 3-0 halftime lead, but then had a penalty saved by goalkeeper Simon Mignolet, as the Serie A side were knocked out with a 5-2 aggregate defeat.

Gasperini singled out the Nigeria international for criticism, adding offensive midfielder Charles De Ketelaere or striker Mateo Retegui should have taken the penalty instead.

""Lookman was not supposed to take that penalty, he is one of the worst penalty takers I've ever seen,"" the Italian manager told a post-match press conference.

""He has a frankly terrible record even in training, he converts very few of them. Retegui and De Ketelaere were there, but Lookman in a moment of enthusiasm after scoring decided to take the ball and that was a gesture I did not appreciate at all.""

Gasperini also criticised Atalanta captain Rafael Toloi, who was shown a straight red card for a shove on Maxim De Cuyper after an argument over a throw-in.

""That was an ugly incident and we must never lose our heads,"" he said.

""Atalanta must leave the Champions League with dignity, having played great games against the likes of Real Madrid, Arsenal and Barcelona.""

Atalanta, third in Serie A, became the second Italian side to exit the Champions League, following AC Milan, who drew 1-1 with Feyenoord, losing 2-1 on aggregate.

Blum was seen fetching her husband from a San Fernando Valley home, People reported.

Toting a duffle bag, he got into Blum’s car and they drove off while chatting, though neither appeared to be wearing wedding rings, People said.

The apparent camaraderie would be in keeping with Blum’s stance following Grohl’s announcement last September.

In an Instagram post, he admitted he had cheated on his wife of more than 20 years, owning up to the new arrival and vowing to be an active and present dad to the child.

Grohl and Blum share three daughters aged 10, 15 and 18, and Blum had indicated she didn’t want to break up their family.

The Foo Fighters cancelled a high-profile Connecticut gig at the last minute right after the scandal broke.

Grohl hired a divorce attorney just before making his announcement, then stepped back in November 2024 as the couple decided to work on their marriage.

The following month he announced he’d be spending Christmas with his wife and their daughters “as a family” as he sought to regain his family’s trust. – New York Daily News/Tribune News Service",Lifestyle,Entertainment,Complimentary,Short,,2025-02-19,,The Foo Fighters frontman revealed last September that he'd fathered a baby with another woman.,https://www.thestar.com.my/lifestyle/entertainment/2025/02/19/dave-grohl-wife-jordyn-blum-spotted-in-public-for-first-time-since-baby-scandal,https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/02/18/3173832.jpg,218

1560432,Rugby-Argentine court upholds dismissal of rape charges against two French players,"(Reuters) - An Argentine appeal court has confirmed the dismissal of aggravated rape charges against French international rugby players Hugo Auradou and Oscar Jegou, according to the case file seen by Reuters.

""After analysing all the evidence gathered in the case, it is clear that the version of events maintained by the plaintiff is not supported by the objective elements in the case file,"" the ruling stated.

""On the contrary, the video evidence, the testimonies, the medical and psychological expert reports, as well as the messages from the plaintiff in the hours and days following the events, have implacably refuted the accusatory hypothesis.""

The complainant, a 39-year-old woman, had appealed against the December 10 dismissal of the case and a hearing was held early last week.

""This is the judicial epilogue of this case, which is symbolic and special because it has shown that you can be accused without foundation by someone who lied to the courts,"" Auradou's and Jegou's French lawyer Antoine Vey told Reuters.

""We've had a succession of rulings that have established the players' innocence.""

Auradou and Jegou, both 21, had been under investigation since July 12 for alleged aggravated rape — a charge used for suspected gang rape — in Argentina's western Mendoza province after they made their international debuts.

The two players always denied any wrongdoing and said the sex was consensual.

Auradou and Jegou played the first two Six Nations matches for France against Wales and England, and are part of the squad preparing to face Italy on Sunday.

1561093,Soccer-Botafogo deal with coach Matos collapses in license debacle,"(Reuters) - Portuguese club Santa Clara have extended the contract of their manager Vasco Matos until 2027, they said on Wednesday, after a deal for him to join Brazilian champions Botafogo fell through due to a coaching license debacle.

Matos, who led Santa Clara to Portugal's second division title last year and to fifth in the top-flight standings, reached an agreement with Botafogo on Monday. He was set to replace his compatriot Artur Jorge who joined Qatar's Al-Rayyan in December after guiding the Brazilian club to the league and Copa Libertadores double.

However, sources close to both clubs told Reuters that Botafogo's owner, American businessman John Textor, found out on Tuesday that Matos did not have the UEFA Pro License required for coaching at the highest level in South America, so would not be allowed to manage the team in their Copa Libertadores title defence.

Botafogo tried to rework the deal with Matos while attempting to find out if South American soccer's ruling body Conmebol would accept a provisional registration until he upgraded his licence.

The licensing of coaches has been a controversial issue in Portugal recently, with aspiring coaches and professional managers calling for fairer access to the necessary certification.

Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim was handed multiple fines for not having the required licences while coaching his former clubs Casa Pia, Braga and Sporting.

Botafogo will continue their search for a new manager with interim coach Claudio Cacapa in charge for Thursday's Recopa final first leg at Copa Sudamericana champions Racing in Buenos Aires.

1560412,Motor racing-F1 seeks to spice up Monaco GP with more mandatory pitstops,"LONDON (Reuters) -Formula One's governing body is planning to spice up the showcase Monaco Grand Prix by forcing teams to carry out more pitstops.

The FIA said in a statement that an F1 commission meeting in London on Tuesday, ahead of a 10-team season's launch, had discussed ""proposals for Monaco-specific regulations"" to promote less processional racing at the tight and twisty circuit.

""The commission agreed to increase the numbers of mandatory pitstops in the race,"" it added, without providing further details.

""These proposals will be further discussed by the sporting advisory committee in the coming weeks.""

The current mandatory minimum is one pitstop per race.

Overtaking is extremely difficult around the streets of Monaco, with qualifying and pole position even more crucial than at other races.

""You can't change the layout of the circuit and of course, as we've seen previously and particularly with these cars as big as they are now, the race is very much dictated by the Saturday,"" said Red Bull boss Christian Horner.

""What we saw last year was if you get a red flag early on and everybody just puts another (kind of) tyre on, then it's very static.

""So stating that you have to use potentially all three (tyre) compounds brings in another element, so it becomes a two-stop race and should it rain as well there would also be a mandatory two-stop.

""It's unique to that race and it's really due to the nature of the circuit.""

The FIA said there would also no longer be any restriction on the number of gearboxes teams could use during a season as the reliability of current designs had rendered the regulation obsolete.

The RM1.2mil funding for the rehabilitation of Sungai Durin, Sungai Naman and Sungai Assan is provided by Drainage and Irrigation Department (DID), said PDP Dudong chairman Datuk Teo Boon Siew.

Teo, who had lobbied for the cleanup, said Tourism, Arts and Culture Minister Datuk Seri Tiong King Sing, who is also Dudong assemblyman, played a crucial role in securing government approval for the funding.

“These three rivers have not been cleaned for nearly 50 years.

Community activist Yee Poh Ping said the trees had not been adequately trimmed, leaving overgrown branches to dangle dangerously above the stalls.

One of the stall operators, who wanted to be known only as Low, said large tree branches falling onto the zinc roof of his stall had caused considerable damage.

A customer at the stall said a branch had once fallen and smashed his car’s windscreen.

Both individuals ended up paying for the damage out of their own pocket.

Low said fallen branches and leaves accumulated on the zinc roof and canopy tops of these stalls and remained uncollected.

“The accumulated weight of the debris will eventually overload the roof,” he added.

About 10 stalls line the road but some have been abandoned.

StarMetro observed several empty tents and tables left behind, while the area was also littered with rubbish, including a discarded sofa.

Low also pointed out that the area’s drains, which used to be cleaned regularly, had not been maintained for some time.

Yee urged Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) to address the issue.

He suggested that the food stalls be upgraded into a proper food court, complete with seating.

The club's wage bill increased to 327.8 million pounds, which was a significant increase from 234.8 million pounds in 2023.

""The increase was mainly driven by investment in player wages in both men's and women's teams. There was also an impact from increased commercial and operational headcount,"" the club said in a statement.

""The total profit on sale of player registrations was 51.1 million pounds (2023: 10.7 million pounds).""

Renewing and extending their deal with Emirates helped the club's commercial performance improve to 218.3 million pounds.

Arsenal also said they continue to be compliant with all applicable financial sustainability regulations put in place by European soccer body UEFA and the Premier League.

The North London club are second in the league this season, seven points behind Liverpool, while they are also through to the last 16 of the Champions League.

1561097,Soccer-Bellingham handed two-match suspension for verbally abusing referee,"MADRID (Reuters) - Real Madrid midfielder Jude Bellingham has been given a two-match ban for verbally abusing a referee during his team's 1-1 LaLiga draw at Osasuna on Saturday, the Spanish FA (RFEF) said on Wednesday.

Bellingham, 21, was sent off by referee Jose Munuera Montero who thought the England international had directed abusive language at him.

Although Bellingham and his coach Carlo Ancelotti said the official had been mistaken, the RFEF Disciplinary Committee did not agree and imposed the punishment for ""attitudes of contempt or lack of consideration towards referees"".

Real Madrid said they will appeal to try to have Bellingham available for LaLiga games against Girona and Betis.

Saturday's incident sparked an unlikely debate in Spanish media about translation and cultural interpretations of English profanity. It also fuelled a feud between Real Madrid and the country's soccer authorities after Real lodged a letter of complaint against LaLiga's referees after what they said were a number of unfair decisions.

RFEF issued an statement on Tuesday saying referees were sickened by the abuse Montero has received since sending Bellingham off.

Montero believed the 21-year-old England midfielder had directed foul language at him during Saturday's 1-1 draw at Osasuna and showed him a straight red card. However, Bellingham and his coach Carlo Ancelotti said the official was mistaken.

""The professional referees are absolutely repulsed by the attacks and threats that our colleague Jose Luis Munuera Montero is receiving through social networks, which not only target him personally but also his family,"" the RFEF said in a statement late on Monday.

""These attacks add to the hatred and verbal violence through which we have to carry out our professional work every weekend, and that in the base categories becomes, even more regrettably, physical violence in many cases.""

Bellingham could face a lengthy ban under guidelines for the use of ""offensive terms or attitudes"" towards match officials but the player said the referee had misunderstood him.

""I'm an English player... and when I speak on the pitch it's normal that I use expressions that come naturally to me in English,"" he told reporters on Saturday.

The FA charged the Premier League club after the players surrounded referee Michael Oliver after he showed Lewis-Skelly a straight red card for a foul on Matt Doherty on January 25.

""An independent Regulatory Commission has imposed a £65,000 fine on Arsenal ... (as) it was alleged that Arsenal failed to ensure their players did not behave in an improper way around the 43rd minute, and the club subsequently admitted to this charge,"" the FA said in a statement.

The video assistant referee (VAR) upheld Oliver's decision at the time of the incident but Arsenal subsequently appealed against the red card and the 18-year-old's three-match ban was overturned.

The FA's statement included a letter from Arsenal, who highlighted that the players ""did not behave in a way which was offensive, violent, threatening, abusive, indecent, insulting or provocative.""

But the FA responded by saying that ""there were, at times, nine AFC players in very close proximity to the referee"" and that the red card ""being overturned on appeal does not justify the reaction and affords no mitigation.""

1559435,Indonesian parliament set to vote on amendment to mining law,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's parliament is set to vote on Tuesday on a bill to revise the country's mining law to boost development of domestic mineral processing industries and regulate mining permits for religious groups and universities.

The amendment aims to encourage participations of smaller-scale businesses in mining sectors and to ensure ore supply security for mineral processing industries, as resource-rich Indonesia seeks to further develop its domestic metals sector.

A draft bill was approved in a meeting late on Monday between a key parliamentary body and the government and is expected to be formally endorsed in a wider vote during a plenary meeting on Tuesday.

The new mining law will grant priority access to mining concessions for companies that aim to build processing facilities.

Religious groups and universities, through a business unit under their control, will also be given priority access to certain mining areas to give them a source of income.

In the past, such priority has only been given to state-owned companies.

""This amendment to the law also provides us with certainty as we try to reorganise our mining licensing,"" Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Bahlil Lahadalia told the meeting on Monday.

The law revision was also to satisfy a 2021 constitutional court order to revise a number of articles related to mining that the court said were unconstitutional.

1559248,"Five friends cycle across Malaysia, raising RM50k for children with cancer","A TEAM of five youths collected close to RM50,000 during a 900km journey across Peninsular Malaysia to raise funds and awareness of childhood cancer.

Brothers Chong Zen, 17, Chong Zac, 14, and childhood friends Ch’ng Xiang Zhe, 17, Yu Zemin, 18, and Lim Tzi Yuan, 17, are from Penang.

The group’s “Hearts on Wheels” initiative was aimed at benefitting the non-profit Sarawak Children’s Cancer Society (SCCS).

The Kuching-based society provides care and support for children suffering from childhood cancer and their families.

According to SCCS communications executive Agatha Lee, the team started their journey on Feb 5, cycling over six days from Johor to Perlis.

They raised RM49,661, surpassing their RM30,000 target.

Lee credits Lily Liew, a long-term supporter of SCCS and mother of the two brothers on the “Hearts on Wheels” mission.

“Liew shaved her head in 2016 for SCCS’ annual GoBald fundraiser, demonstrating her commitment to children battling cancer,” said Lee.

Liew accompanied the group on the cycling journey to offer support and encouragement.

1559592,"OpenAI weighs special voting rights to guard against hostile takeovers, FT reports","(Reuters) -OpenAI is considering granting special voting rights to its non-profit board to preserve the power of its directors, as the ChatGPT-maker fends off an unsolicited takeover bid from Elon Musk, Financial Times reported on Tuesday.

Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman and board members are evaluating new governance measures as the company transitions to a traditional for-profit structure, the report said, citing people with direct knowledge of the discussions.

OpenAI did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

While no firm decisions have been made, the move could help OpenAI block future hostile takeover attempts, including from Musk, who co-founded the company with Altman but later departed.

On Friday, OpenAI rejected a $97.4 billion acquisition offer from a consortium led by Musk, saying the startup is not for sale and dismissing any future bids as disingenuous.

Musk's offer is his latest effort to prevent OpenAI from becoming a profit-driven company as it seeks more funding to stay competitive in the artificial intelligence race.

If implemented, the special voting rights would allow the non-profit board to overrule major investors, including backers like Microsoft and SoftBank, ensuring it retains decision-making power, the report said.

Johor Baru mayor Datuk Mohd Haffiz Ahmad said the city council would not hesitate to take action against violators, including seizing their stalls.

“Bazaar organisers are reminded not to allow foreigners to operate at sites approved by MBJB.

“Action will also be taken against stall owners who abuse their licences by renting them out to foreigners,” he said after chairing his first MBJB full board meeting as the new Johor Baru mayor.

1559245,Kepong residents irked by incessant road noise,"RESIDENTS of an apartment complex are irked by traffic congestion on Jalan Metro Perdana Barat in Kepong, Kuala Lumpur.

Community activist Yee Poh Ping said several complaints have been lodged about vehicles double-parking along the road in front of Fortune Perdana Lakeside Residences that contributed to the congestion in the area.

He said the shops in the complex were popular but there were not enough parking bays for customers.

He added that it was also common to see lorries blocking traffic as goods were unloaded in front of certain shops during business hours.

Yee said tempers would flare and motorists end up honking at one another as traffic came to a standstill in both directions.

A resident who wanted to be known only as Kok said noise from the road could be heard even on the 16th floor of the apartment complex.

“The noise reverberates throughout the complex until night, before quieting down as shops close for the day,” said Kok.

She added that residents also had to use other entry and exit points to access the complex because of congestion.

Yee said at least 13 business owners operating at the complex’s shoplots had signed a petition calling for realignment of the road.

It was previously reported that the congestion in the area had been brought to the attention of Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) in January 2024.

Yee said in July last year, a DBKL-appointed consultant had examined the road and found that it was suitable to be changed from the current two-way system to one-way traffic.

1559559,DeepSeek in running to power China weather agency’s forecasts,"China’s state weather agency is considering using DeepSeek, the local startup whose artificial intelligence model shook global markets last month, to power its forecasts and observations.

The China Meteorological Administration discussed ""promoting the in-depth integration and application of DeepSeek” and ""continuously improving the AI meteorological model” in a Feb 14 meeting attended by the agency’s chief engineer, Pan Jinjun.

DeepSeek has demonstrated a breakthrough lower-cost AI model that is seen as being competitive with those of OpenAI and Meta Platforms Inc. However, some have questioned the Chinese startup’s numbers. High-Flyer, the quant hedge fund that developed DeepSeek, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

China has ambitions to be a ""weather superpower”, and wants to close the technological gap with leading meteorological powerhouses like the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Integrating AI into the government’s meteorological work is seen as a key step in that direction, according to official long-term weather sector development plans issued by key entities including the State Council, the Ministry of Science and Technology, and the CMA.

The agency’s push to leverage AI in its work is gathering pace. In October, it issued draft legislation on the use of AI in weather-related services, touching on regulatory issues including data security and algorithm reviews. And last summer, it established an institute in Hebei province to drive weather AI innovation.

The CMA’s enthusiasm for DeepSeek comes as Beijing appears to be embracing its domestic tech companies once more, more than four years since the central government’s crackdown on the tech giants began in late 2020.

1559541,Vietnam parliament to approve plan for leaner government,"HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam's National Assembly will on Tuesday approve a bold bureaucratic reform plan that will slash up to a fifth of government bodies, as it tries to cut costs and improve administrative efficiency.

The assembly earlier on Tuesday passed an amendment to a Law on Organising the Government, paving the way for a cull of 15% to 20% of the state apparatus that will include five ministries, four agencies and five state television channels, among other cuts.

The move would ""not only save money for the state budget but more importantly, boost the efficiency of the system"", General Secretary of Vietnam's ruling Communist Party, To Lam, told parliament last week.

Investors, diplomats and officials have broadly welcomed the plan but expect some administrativedelays in the short term in Vietnam, a regional industrial hub that relies heavily on foreign investment.

The government has said the overhaul would not impact project approvals.

The planning and investment ministry, which approves foreign investment projects, will join the finance ministry, while the transport ministry and the construction ministry will be merged.

The natural resources and environment ministry and the agriculture ministry will also be merged.

The plan coincides with similar post-pandemic government cost-cutting measures being implemented or pledged across the world, including by Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei and U.S. President Donald Trump.

Vietnam's state media last month reported the restructuring would affect 100,000 state officials. It did not elaborate.

The talks are meant to precede a meeting between the U.S. and Russian presidents.

Dmitriev, a U.S.-educated former Goldman Sachs banker, played a role in early contacts between Moscow and Washington during Trump's first term as president from 2016-2020.

""It's very important to understand that U.S. businesses lost around $300 billion from leaving Russia. So there is huge economic toll on many countries from you know what's happening right now, and we believe as a way forward is through solutions,"" Dmitriev said.

""A difficult night for the Kirovohrad region,"" Andriy Raikovych, the region's governor, said in a post on the Telegram messaging app. ""An enemy drone hit a high-rise building in Dolynska.""

The mother and one of the children were taken to hospital, said Raikovych, who posted photos of flames bursting out of windows of a high-storey apartment building.

The Ukrainian military said on Tuesday that Russia launched 176 drones in a large-scale attack.

Ukraine's air force shot down 103 of the drones and 67 did not reach their targets, probably due to electronic countermeasures, the military said.

It did not specify what happened to the remaining six drones, but said that Kirovohrad, Kharkiv, Kyiv and Cherkasy regions were impacted.

Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said that drone debris fell in one of the districts of the capital, causing a fire at an industrial enterprise.

Reuters could not independently verify the report. There was no immediate comment from Russia.

Both Moscow and Kyiv deny targeting civilians in the war, which Russia started with its full-scale invasion on Ukraine nearly three years ago. But thousands of civilians have died in the conflict, the vast majority of them Ukrainian.

The attack took place as top Russian and U.S. officials are meeting in Saudi Arabia for talks - without the participation of Kyiv or its European allies - on how to end the war in Ukraine.

The raids of the last five days came as Turkey continues to remove elected pro-Kurdish mayors from their posts over militant ties in a crackdown coinciding with hopes for an end to a 40-year conflict between the PKK and authorities.

Jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan is expected to make a statement on such efforts, four months after an ally of President Tayyip Erdogan urged him to call on the militants to lay down their arms.

The Journalists' Union of Turkey condemned the detention of three journalists.

""We do not accept that they are detained through house raids instead of being summoned to the police station,"" the union said in a statement on social media.

Those detained included members of the Peoples’ Democratic Congress (HDK), as well as smaller leftist parties, academics and a prominent LGBTQ rights activist.

Police carried out counter-terror raids in 51 provinces, including the capital Ankara and the largest city, Istanbul. Yerlikaya said the suspects were accused of conducting PKK propaganda, providing financing for the group, recruiting members, and joining street protests.

Police seized two AK-47 rifles among other weapons, he added.

On Saturday, Turkey removed a pro-Kurdish DEM Party mayor from office in the eastern province of Van over terrorism-related convictions, bringing the total number of dismissed DEM mayors to eight since the 2024 elections.

The PKK, designated a terrorist organization by Turkey and its Western allies, has waged an insurgency against the state since 1984, in a conflict that has killed more than 40,000.

1559784,"Higher proportion of migrants does not mean more crime, German institute says","BERLIN (Reuters) - An higher proportion of foreigners in Germany does not lead to a higher crime rate, a research institute said on Tuesday, five days ahead of an election in which violent attacks linked to migrants have pushed security to the top of the agenda.

In an analysis of police statistics from 2018 to 2023, the Ifo institute found ""no correlation between an increasing proportion of foreigners in a district and the local crime rate"", researcher Jean-Victor Alipour said, adding that this also applied to refugees.

Immigration and security issues have dominated campaigning ahead of the February 23 election, especially after a series of violent incidents in recent weeks, with polls showing the centre-right CDU/CSU bloc leading followed by the far right.

Last week, an Afghan immigrant ploughed his car into a crowd in Munich, injuring over 30 people, two of whom later died. Prosecutors suspect he was motivated by Islamist ideology.

In their analysis, Ifo took into account that foreigners appear in crime statistics more frequently than would correspond to their share of the population. The reason for this is that migrants are more likely to move to urban centres with a structurally higher crime rate, even among Germans, the institute said.

Popular Taiwanese actress-host Barbie Hsu, also known as Big S, died on Feb 2 at the age of 48 from pneumonia.

In social media clips posted by concertgoers, Rain, 42, called Hsu his “sister-in-law” as Koo is like a big brother to him.

He said: “I’ve never met her before, but as a junior (in the industry) who is here in Taiwan, I think it is only basic decency to pray for them and have a moment of silence.”

“(Koo) is a senior in the industry whom I respect very much. Even though I can’t see him in person, I still want to pray for him from somewhere far away,” he added.

“Among all the people I know, he’s truly the best senior one can have, he’s a kind and upright person.”

Singer-actor Show Lo, 45, who was a co-host with the Hsu sisters on the variety programme 100% Entertainment (1997 to 2004) and also played Barbie Hsu’s love interest in the romance drama Corner With Love (2007), got emotional as well at his Feb 14 concert in Tokyo.

1556914,Potential link between microplastics and premature births,"Microplastics and nanoplastics are more likely to show up in the placentae of premature babies than those born full-term, according to a team of United States-based doctors.

The discovery means that there is a “possibility” that the plastic shards “could be contributing to the risk and occurrence of preterm birth,” according to Boston Children’s Hospital maternal-foetal medicine specialist Dr Kjersti Aagaard.

Microplastics are smaller than 5mm, while nanoplastics are too tiny to be seen by the human eye.

In recent years, they have been found in male reproductive organs and have been shown to pass from mother to unborn baby.

“When combined with other recent research, this study adds to the growing body of evidence, ranging from heart disease to potentially stroke, that demonstrates a real risk of exposure to plastics on human health and disease,” said Dr Aagaard.

“The finding of higher placental concentrations among preterm births was surprising because it was counter-intuitive to what you might expect if it was merely a byproduct of the length of time of the pregnancy,” said Baylor College of Medicine assistant professor of obstetrics and gynaecology Dr Enrico Barrozo.

The team’s research was based on “highly sensitive” mass spectrometry analysis of 175 placentae, 100 of which were at term and 75 collected preterm or at less than 37 weeks of pregnancy.

Despite dominating the first period, Inter conceded a second-half goal through Portuguese winger Francisco Conceicao, who brought the Allianz stadium to its feet after 74 minutes following some clever footwork from Randal Kolo Muani.

""There is a lot of regret and disappointment, but the boys showed great organisation and courage,"" Inzaghi told DAZN.

""We needed to score more goals and finish the first half with a lead,"" he added, pointing to Inter's recent away defeats, including a 3-0 loss at Fiorentina, to underline the need for improvement.

The coach explained that his decision to make three substitutions in the 62nd minute was due to Juve's superiority after the break and Inter's lack of fluency.

""We had to do better, the last situation was wrong. In the nine years I've been in Turin, I've never had so many chances. It hurts to lose, we really wanted to win. Everything is still open, but we need to change the tempo,"" added Inzaghi.

Inter could have finally moved ahead in the title race after Napoli were held to a 2-2 draw at Lazio on Saturday but now sit two points off the pace with 54 from 25 games.

1559142,Cricket-Australia's Kuhnemann to sit out Shield match ahead of bowling action tests,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia spin bowler Matthew Kuhnemann will sit out Tasmania's Sheffield Shield match against South Australia ahead of testing on his bowling action.

The left-arm spinner was reported by match officials for having a suspected illegal action after taking 16 wickets in Australia's 2-0 test series win over Sri Lanka.

Kuhnemann was expected to play the Shield match starting in Adelaide on Tuesday but was ruled out on Monday, with the team citing a long-standing thumb injury on his non-bowling hand.

Kuhnemann had surgery last month after breaking his thumb playing for Brisbane Heat in the Big Bash League in January but carried the injury through two tests against Sri Lanka in Galle.

Kuhnemann's omission from the Shield match paves the way for testing on his action in coming days.

He is expected to be examined by International Cricket Council (ICC) officials at the National Cricket Centre in Brisbane.

The case has generated debate in Australia because of the 28-year-old's previously spotless record in more than 100 professional matches dating back to 2017, including five tests and four one-day internationals.

Steve Smith, who captained Australia against Sri Lanka in place of the injured Pat Cummins, said over the weekend he expected Kuhnemann to be cleared.

Tasmania captain Jordan Silk said his team were throwing their support behind the bowler.

""He has obviously had a fantastic couple of weeks away with the Aussie side, and was a big factor in them winning that series over there,"" Silk told Australian media on Monday.

""It's come as a shock to a lot of people, but all we can do as an organisation is wrap our arms around him and look forward to having him back around the group.""

1551657,Are goji berries good for us?,"Goji berries are one of the better-known superfoods, and they are widely available in dried form in supermarkets, organic food stores and chemists.

They are reputed to be particularly good for you, but is there any truth in this?

Let’s start with a look at the nutrients you get from them.

“They contain many carotenoids, vitamin C, iron, calcium, but also fibre,” says Daniela Krehl from the Bavarian Consumer Advice Centre in Germany.

However, Krehl warns that because they are dried fruits, their sugar content is also high – up to 46%.

This means that goji berries are significantly higher in calories than other sources of vitamin C, such as sweet peppers or blackcurrants.

The berries are said to strengthen the immune system and have an anti-ageing effect, though there is no scientific evidence for this.

The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has found that there is no causal link between any claimed special health effects and eating goji berries, so these health claims are not allowed on advertising.

The Bavarian consumer advice centre says that goji berries are not suitable for everyone since they can interact with medication.

Goji berries can inhibit the breakdown of certain blood thinners, known as vitamin K antagonists.

This can result in a dangerous build-up of the active ingredient in the body, and in some cases, cause an increased tendency to bleed. – dpa",Lifestyle,Nutrition,Complimentary,Short,,2025-02-16,"Nutrition,Goji berries,superfood,nutrition","Also known as Chinese wolfberries, these dried fruits are touted as a superfood.",https://www.thestar.com.my/lifestyle/health/2025/02/16/are-goji-berries-good-for-us,https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/02/07/3155852.jpeg,230

1556005,Google and OpenAI back new safety tools to combat child sexual abuse,"LONDON: Google, OpenAI and children’s gaming platform Roblox are among the firms backing a new initiative to provide free online safety tools to firms around the globe.

The initiative, known as Robust Open Online Safety Tools (Roost), will help firms otherwise unable to afford or build their own safety mechanisms gain access to technology to help detect, review and report child sexual abuse material, and use AI to help power other safety features.

The scheme has also been backed by former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt, online messaging platform Discord and several academic and research organisations, and was announced during the first day of the AI Action Summit in Paris.

The summit is hosting world leaders, tech firms and academics for a range of talks on the future of AI and how the technology can be used in a range of fields including sustainability and safety, as well as how it could impact society.

Schmidt said the scheme “addresses a critical need to accelerate innovation in online child safety and AI by providing small companies and non-profits access to technologies they currently lack”.

He said the “collaborative, open-source approach” would help “foster innovation”, and help create a “safer internet for everyone”.

The summit is being attended by tech figures including Google boss Sundar Pichai and OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman, as well as a number of world leaders and senior figures including US Vice President JD Vance and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, with many nations looking to use the summit to showcase their own potential leadership of the AI space. – PA Media/dpa",Tech,Internet,Complimentary,Short,,2025-02-16,"Internet,Technology,Children","Google, OpenAI and children’s gaming platform Roblox are among the firms backing a new initiative to provide free online safety tools to firms around the globe.",https://www.thestar.com.my/tech/tech-news/2025/02/16/google-and-openai-back-new-safety-tools-to-combat-child-sexual-abuse,https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/02/13/3165256.jpeg,264
1557987,Argentina’s opposition threatens impeachment trial after Milei touts crypto coin,"(This Feb.15 story has been refiled to correct the spelling of the crypto coin to $LIBRA, not $LIBRE, in paragraph 2)

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentine President Javier Milei could face an impeachment trial in Congress, opposition lawmakers said on Saturday, after the libertarian leader touted a cryptocurrency which crashed soon after.

Milei late on Friday posted on X recommending the little-known crypto coin $LIBRA, which soon after shot up to nearly $5 apiece.

Just hours later, the cryptocurrency plummeted to under $1.

Argentina’s fintech chamber acknowledged that the case could potentially be a “rug pull,” in which the developers of a crypto token draw legitimate investments, pumping up the value, only to later dump their stake.

“This scandal, which embarrasses us on an international scale, requires us to launch an impeachment request against the president,” said lawmaker Leandro Santoro, a member of the opposition coalition.

Milei deleted the post on X, with local media saying the post had been up for a few hours on Friday night. He later said he took down his post after becoming aware of the circumstances, and that he had no relation to the cryptocurrency.

“I was not aware of the details of the project and once I found out, I decided to not continue giving it publicity,” he said.

1551658,Tired of cow's milk? Why not try milk from a camel,"Goat milk not only makes for great cheese, it has long been recommended to asthmatics and is sometimes described as more easily digested than cow milk.

According to a team of Australia-based scientists, there’s another source that could in ways offer an even healthier alternative to cow milk: the camel.

Camel milk has “more native and tryptic bioactive peptides than cow milk” and is “potentially less allergenic” as it “lacks beta-lactoglobulin”, according to the researchers, whose findings were published by the journal Food Chemistry.

These peptides have antimicrobial and anti-hypertensive properties, according to the team from Edith Cowan University, the University of Sydney, the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Innovations in Peptide and Protein Science, and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation.

According to Edith Cowan University, not only is camel milk hypoallergenic, it “could potentially protect the gut from harmful enzymes and create healthier digestion”.

But even if camel milk has unique health benefits, proponents of cow milk need not get the hump: after all, camel milk “showed significant overlap with cow milk” when examined by the researchers.

And the camel only accounts for around 0.4% of global milk supply – the fifth most – with buffalo, sheep and goats making up the top four behind the dominant dairy cow.

And even if other sources of milk “are gaining attention”, in part because of “perceived superior health benefits”, as the researchers put it, cow milk dominates, making up around 80% global production and consumption.

A well-fed healthy cow can churn out over 25l of milk in a day – five times as much as a camel and up to ten times what a goat can provide. – dpa",Lifestyle,Nutrition,Complimentary,Short,,2025-02-15,"Nutrition,Camel milk,milk,nutrition",This drome-dairy alternative offers certain health benefits not available from its bovine counterpart.,https://www.thestar.com.my/lifestyle/health/2025/02/15/tired-of-cow039s-milk-why-not-try-milk-from-a-camel,https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/02/07/3155854.jpeg,282

Shares of the company gained 4% after the report, which said Dell would sell servers containing Nvidia's GB200 semiconductors to the AI startup for delivery this year.

Details are still being discussed and may change, the report added.

The AI server maker declined to comment. Representatives for Musk, who owns xAI, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

AI servers have been seeing strong demand from enterprises looking for hardware capable of powering complex applications. Musk's companies, including Tesla and xAI, have emerged as major customers for such hardware.

In December, the Greater Memphis Chamber had said xAI plans to expand its Memphis, Tennessee, supercomputer to house at least one million graphics processing units.

That would represent a massive expansion for the supercomputer called Colossus, which currently has 100,000 GPUs to train xAI's chatbot called Grok.

As part of the expansion, Nvidia, which supplies the GPUs, and Dell and Super Micro, which have assembled the server racks for the computer, will establish operations in Memphis.

Bloomberg News reported last month that Hewlett Packard Enterprise had struck a deal worth more than $1 billion to provide Musk's social media platform X with servers optimized for AI work.

1557244,UK's Segro plans data centre strategy shift as AI booms,"(Reuters) - Segro, which has historically offered data centres equipped only with power connections, plans to develop full-fledged facilities to directly serve major cloud providers like Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet's Google in a bid to shore up rental income.

The largest-listed European property company is looking to capitalise the surge in demand for data centres, a trend fuelled by the growing reliance on AI systems, which require specialised infrastructure like high capacity power supply and advanced cooling systems.

Typically, Segro leases out data centres to firms that add infrastructure such as chillers, generators, and dividing walls before sub-leasing to tech companies, which then add their own technology.

Under the new strategy, the London-based company will lease data centres fitted with required infrastructure directly to end users.

""A 'powered shell' might cost 50 million pounds ($62.9 million) to build, whereas a 'fully fitted' data centre could require around 500 million pounds. However, rental income could jump from 5 million pounds to 50 million pounds,"" Segro CFO Soumen Das told Reuters.

Segro currently earns about 650 million pounds in annual rent from its broader portfolio, and Das added that a single fully fitted data centre would have a noticeable impact on overall revenue.

The group, which mainly owns big box and urban warehouses among other assets, has 34 'powered shells', all in London and Slough, accounting for 8% of its overall portfolio.

The London- and Paris-listed firm said it is planning for its new data centres to also incorporate 'fully fitted' facilities, but did not provide additional details or a timeline.

However the new strategy comes with a trade-off, with Das saying fully fitted spaces would depreciate faster than the 'powered shells', potentially impacting long-term performance.

1557217,Brighter traffic light poles a success in Bukit Mertajam,"TO ENHANCE road safety and urban infrastructure, Seberang Perai City Council (MBSP) introduced LED installations on traffic light poles.

The poles are now lined with LED strips that change colour in sync with traffic lights.

The full-pole illumination ensures that traffic signals are visible from greater distances and across wider angles.

This, in turn, reduces the risk of missed signals, especially in poor weather.

The project began in March last year at a traffic intersection near MBSP headquarters in Bandar Perda, Bukit Mertajam, Penang.

There have been positive results in terms of road user awareness as well as urban aesthetics, said Seberang Perai mayor Datuk Baderul Amin Abdul Hamid.

“This upgrade improves traffic signal visibility, helping drivers and pedestrians respond more effectively.

“It also enhances the vibrancy of the city, attracting visitors and boosting local economic activity,” he said.

With a budget of RM55,000, Baderul Amin said the project served as a test bed for expansion, even though financial constraints had prevented wider use.

“If the project continues to prove effective, MBSP will find ways to optimise costs and extend the system to other intersections,” he said.

Bloomberg News reported earlier that the app’s launch was imminent.

The move marks the rare occasion when Apple is offering services on Google’s Android, its biggest competitor in smartphone software. Though Apple provides its Music service as an Android app, it typically tries to keep customers within the bounds of its own product ecosystem.

Taking this step suggests that Apple is trying to boost the appeal of TV+ and challenge streaming services like Netflix and Disney+. Though the iPhone maker has had hits on the platform, such as Severance and Ted Lasso, it lags well behind the biggest platforms in viewers, according to industry estimates. Apple has never disclosed subscriber or revenue figures for TV+.

Launched at US$4.99 (RM22) per month, Apple TV+ now costs US$9.99 (RM44) monthly. Bloomberg News first reported last year that Apple was working on an Android app for TV+. A spokesperson for the Cupertino, California-based company declined to comment.

In addition to the TV+ move, Apple will allow users to access its MLS Season Pass on the Android TV+ app. Apple launched that service, which lets fans watch Major League Soccer matches, in February 2023. – Bloomberg",Tech,Streaming,Complimentary,Short,,2025-02-14,"Streaming,Mobile apps,Technology,Internet",Taking this step suggests that Apple is trying to boost the appeal of TV+ and challenge streaming services like Netflix and Disney+.,https://www.thestar.com.my/tech/tech-news/2025/02/14/apple-brings-tv-to-android-phones-in-bid-to-boost-subscribers,https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/02/13/3166147.jpg,252

1555953,Autonomous buses will soon be taking to the streets of Singapore,"Singapore is confirming its commitment to developing autonomous transport by launching a new call for pilot projects for driverless buses. By 2026, several of these vehicles should be operating on the streets of the city's financial centre.

Singapore's Land Transport Authority (LTA) has announced the deployment, in mid-2026, of the first six 16-seat autonomous buses on routes 400 and 191, serving the Marina Bay and Shenton Way areas in the city-state's business district.

Initially, a driver will be on board as a safety operator. However, after six months of testing, a transition to remote supervision is planned. The idea is to deploy these buses for three years, in order to assess their usefulness, as well as the technical and operational feasibility of this venture prior to possible expansion.

This initiative is part of Singapore's strategy to promote innovative and sustainable transport solutions, particularly in response to the shortage of labor in the transport sector. Other similar projects have already been launched in Singapore, such as an autonomous minibus on the Sentosa island resort. This vehicle covers a 1.2-kilometer route in around 12 minutes, making a total of four stops. Again, although a driver is on board for safety reasons, the vehicle operates mainly autonomously. A few years ago, an autonomous electric bus also ran at Nanyang Technological University (NTU). The government and local companies are working closely together in the field. Their aim is to integrate these new technologies into the public transport system throughout the city-state in the years to come. – AFP Relaxnews",Tech,Technology,Complimentary,Short,,2025-02-14,"Transport,Singapore,Technology,AI","Singapore is confirming its commitment to developing autonomous transport by launching a new call for pilot projects for driverless buses.

1556732,Alibaba to supply AI tech for Apple's iPhones in China: chairman,"Alibaba's chairman said Thursday that the Chinese internet giant would supply artificial intelligence (AI) technology to power Apple's iPhones in the Asian nation.

Apple has suffered from a slump in iPhone sales in China and last year ceded its status as the country's best-selling smartphone brand to two local rivals.

Reports of a tie-up between Alibaba and Apple sent the Chinese firm's share price soaring this week, and chairman Joseph Tsai confirmed Thursday that the California-based company would ""use our AI to power their phones"".

""Inside China, because of regulatory issues and things like that, (Apple) need to work with Chinese companies that develop AI,"" Tsai said at the World Governments Summit in Dubai.

""Apple has been very selective. They talked to a number of companies in China and in the end, they choose to do business with us,"" he said.

""We're very fortunate and... feel extremely honoured to be able to do business with a great company like Apple.""

Alibaba's stock rose more than nine percent in Hong Kong on Thursday but lost much of its gains after Tsai's remarks.

Apple claimed 15 percent of the Chinese smartphone market last year, behind Vivo's 17 percent and Huawei's 16 percent, according to a report by industry data provider Canalys.

Two other domestic brands, Oppo and Honor, also logged market shares of 15 percent, the data showed.

China aims to become a global AI leader by the end of the decade and several Chinese companies are already making waves in the sector.

The state women, family and community development committee chairman said the shelter in Johor Baru would provide a temporary refuge for those affected by domestic violence and divorce.

“It will be the first women’s shelter managed by the state government.

“We will welcome all women in need, regardless of race or religion.

“They can come with their children and stay for up to three weeks, depending on the severity of their situation.

“The shelter is designed to accommodate up to 30 individuals at a time, with all expenses covered by the government,” she said.

Khairin-Nisa added that victims requiring extended stays would have the option to relocate to units in people’s housing projects (PPR) rented by the Johor Islamic Religious Council (MAINJ).

“We are committed to making the shelter a secure and family- friendly environment.

“Priority will be given to those who have been evicted by their husbands or families.

“In addition to access to counselling and psychotherapy, residents will participate in skills training programmes, including the Women’s Income Generating Skills Project (Wings) and the Focused Entrepreneur Inspiration Course (Kiub),” she said.

The double-storey shelter will feature a surau, pantry, counselling rooms, dormitories, activity room, medical room and family room.

Separately, Khairin-Nisa revealed that the state government had allocated RM300,000 this year for the Women Cancer Reproductive Awareness (WCare) programme.

“The success of this campaign is a testament to the power of community and the universal language of music.

“It is heartwarming to see so many come together to support local talent and contribute to the well-being of our musicians,” said Bangsar Heights Pavilion (BHP) chief executive officer and executive director Aaron Yap.

1556557,Soccer-Premier League's profit and sustainability rules to remain in place next season,"LONDON, England (Reuters) - The Premier League's profit and sustainability rules (PSR) will remain in place for at least one more season, the league's clubs agreed on Thursday, delaying the introduction of a new set of financial regulations.

The clubs met in London on Thursday with the implementation of the new Squad Cost Rules (SCR) one of the topics on the table.

While no vote was held, clubs decided to continue discussions around the new regulations after agreeing that they would not be ready in time for next season, a league spokesperson confirmed.

That means that the profit and sustainability rules -- introduced in 2015-16 to prevent clubs from overspending -- would remain in place.

PSR permit clubs to lose no more than 105 million pounds ($131 million) in a three-year cycle.

SCR's proposed rules would limit clubs' spending on player wages, transfers, and agents' fees to 85% of their revenue, which is similar to UEFA's financial sustainability rules that are set at 70%.

SCR would also feature ""anchoring"", which would limit how much clubs could spend on player wages and transfers to five times the revenue that the league's bottom club receives in broadcast and prize money.

SCR has been running as a shadow financial regulation framework this season.

Manchester City, Newcastle United and Aston Villa are among the clubs that have criticised PSR as limiting their ability to spend during transfer windows.

City are facing charges of breaching 115 financial rules between a period starting from 2009 and continuing into the 2022-23 season. City have denied wrongdoing.

A 12-week hearing was conducted by an independent commission and concluded on Dec. 6, with a verdict expected next month.

1557179,Myanmar Border Guard Force launches crackdown on human traffickers in Shwe Kokko,"BANGKOK: The Border Guard Force (BGF) in Karen state on Friday (Feb 14) morning launched an operation against human traffickers and illegal businesses in Shwe Kokko New City, located in Myawaddy township on the Thailand-Myanmar border.

The US$15-billion project has become a notorious hub for illegal gambling, human trafficking, extortion and cyber-scam operations.

BGF spokesperson Deputy Colonel Naing Maung Zaw said the operation was carried out by four special units, with priority on rescuing victims of human traffickers and foreigners who wish to return to their home countries.

Myanmar media “People's Spring” reported that BGF soldiers also destroyed equipment related to illegal business operations.

The agency said 69 Indonesians who were rescued during the crackdown would be sent home on Friday evening.

People's Spring said BGF commanders met on Wednesday and resolved to coordinate with Thai authorities to repatriate 500 victims per day to their home countries.

The operation will be using the Thai-Myanmar Friendship Bridge at Tak-Myawaddy border as a passage to the kingdom.

The BGF move came after Thailand cut off electricity, internet and fuel supplies to five border areas in Myanmar on Feb 5 to combat call centre fraud. Areas affected by the shut-off include Myawaddy, Tachileik, and Phaya Thonsu townships.

The spokesman added that the BGF had facilitated the repatriation of over 2,000 human trafficking victims since 2023, adding that it only rented out the land and had no involvement in any illegal business operations. - The Nation/ANN",AseanPlus,Myanmar,Complimentary,Short,,2025-02-14,"Myanmar,border,human trafficking,Shwe Kokko","BANGKOK: The Border Guard Force (BGF) in Karen state on Friday (Feb 14) morning launched an operation against human traffickers and illegal businesses in Shwe Kokko New City, located in Myawaddy township on the Thailand-Myanmar border.",https://www.thestar.com.my/aseanplus/aseanplus-news/2025/02/14/myanmar-border-guard-force-launches-crackdown-on-human-traffickers-in-shwe-kokko,https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/02/14/3168025.jpg,242
1557173,Fukushima operator starts dismantling water tank,"TOKYO: The operator of Japan's Fukushima nuclear power plant said it started dismantling hundreds of water tanks on Friday (Feb 14), as it takes apart the site of one of the world's worst meltdowns.

Scrapping these welded tanks is a crucial step in Tokyo Electric Power Company's (Tepco) decades-long effort to decommission the stricken facility, which went into meltdown after it was hit by a catastrophic tsunami in 2011.

""The tank dismantling work... started at 8:05am today,"" Tepco spokesman Tatsuya Matoba told AFP.

Since the accident, Tepco has stored around 1.3 million tonnes of water -- a combination of groundwater, seawater and rainwater -- at the plant, along with water used for cooling the reactors.

The water was filtered to remove various radioactive materials, but has remained inside the more than 1,000 tanks that occupy much of the plant's grounds.

After removing the tanks, the utility plans to build facilities to store highly dangerous molten fuel debris to be extracted from inside the reactors.

Scrapping the water tanks became possible after Tepco began releasing the stored water into the Pacific Ocean in August 2023.

Japan has insisted that the treated water does not harm the environment, a position backed by UN atomic watchdog the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

But the move met angry reactions from China, which initially banned imports of Japanese seafood before saying last year it would ""gradually resume"" the trade. - AFP",AseanPlus,Japan,Complimentary,Short,,2025-02-14,"Japan,Tepco,Fukushima,water,tanks","TOKYO: The operator of Japan's Fukushima nuclear power plant said it started dismantling hundreds of water tanks on Friday (Feb 14), as it takes apart the site of one of the world's worst meltdowns.",https://www.thestar.com.my/aseanplus/aseanplus-news/2025/02/14/fukushima-operator-starts-dismantling-water-tank,https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/02/14/3167989.jpg,236

The woman, 40, left the Lawson convenience store in Japan’s south-western city of Fukuoka despite the owner’s demands for her to pay for the bun, said media reports.

The owner tailed her for 1km after she left the shop and restrained her, before calling the police, reported British broadcaster BBC.

She was subsequently arrested on suspicion of destruction of property, reported Japanese news outlet The Mainichi.

The woman, who claimed to be unemployed, denied the allegations and said she had “only pressed it lightly in my hand to check the firmness of the bread”.

She had allegedly picked up a bag of four black sesame and cream cheese buns, which cost about 180 yen (US$1.20), and pressed one of the buns with her right thumb.

According to The Mainichi, the police said that the damaged bun was no longer in its original shape. This meant that the entire bag could not be sold.

U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson issued her order after both parties on Monday said a new SEC task force to review cryptocurrency regulation may ""impact and facilitate the potential resolution of this case.""

Created last month, the SEC task force is led by Republican Commissioner Hester Peirce, a strong cryptocurrency supporter.

The SEC sued Binance and founder Changpeng Zhao in June 2023, accusing the exchange of artificially inflating trading volumes, diverting customer funds and misleading investors about its surveillance controls.

President Donald Trump, a Republican, has pledged to make the United States a global hub for the cryptocurrency industry.

He has nominated Paul Atkins, a Washington lawyer seen as crypto-friendly, to become SEC chair.

Atkins would replace Gary Gensler, who drew much industry opposition for favoring greater cryptocurrency regulation and reining in what he called the industry's ""Wild West"" mentality.

Canada, seeking to address the challenge of taxing digital giants like Google parent Alphabet and Amazon.com that can book their profits in low-tax countries, began imposing the tax in June last year.

Trump tasked his economics team on Thursday with devising a plan to impose reciprocal tariffs on every country that levied duties on U.S. imports.

A White House fact sheet, stating that ""only America should be allowed to tax American firms,"" complained Canada and France used digital services taxes to each collect over $500 million per year from U.S. companies.

""Overall, these non-reciprocal taxes cost America's firms over $2 billion per year. Reciprocal tariffs will bring back fairness and prosperity to the distorted international trade system and stop Americans from being taken advantage of,"" said the fact sheet. It gave no further details.

Last year, under the previous Biden administration, Washington requested trade dispute settlement consultations with Canada over the tax, calling it discriminatory.

""A sham peace - over the heads of Ukrainians and Europeans - would gain nothing,"" Baerbock said in a statement. ""A sham peace would not bring lasting security, neither for the people in Ukraine nor for us in Europe or the United States.""

The comment comes after U.S. President Donald Trump startled U.S. allies by calling Vladimir Putin and announcing the start of peace talks.

Baerbock called for intensive talks with U.S. and international partners at the Munich Security Conference, an annual international gathering of political leaders, military officers and diplomats in the German city.

""Peace will only come through strength. This requires tough and long-term security guarantees for Ukraine, a strong NATO and progress in Ukraine's accession negotiations with the European Union,"" she said.

Rwandan-backed M23 rebels seized eastern Congo's largest city of Goma last month and have been inching south in an advance that a local official has said may trigger a broader catastrophe in an area already housing thousands of displaced people.

UNHCR spokesperson Eujin Byun told journalists in Geneva by video link that around 350,000 internally displaced people had no shelter as their temporary camps had been destroyed or unexploded munitions made it unsafe for them to go home.

About 70% of Goma's camps are destroyed, and others in Minova are damaged, according to UNHCR.

""Hundreds of thousands of people are now living in makeshift accommodation, including churches and hospitals,"" Byun added.

The agency also reported an increase in crime and said the danger of disease was growing as it and other agencies struggle to provide aid amid the fighting.

More than 80 civilians were killed in a late-night attack by the CODECO militia on a cluster of villages in eastern Congo this week, the U.N. peacekeeping mission MONUSCO said on Thursday.

CODECO, one of many militias fighting over land and resources, has frequently attacked the displacement camps, which have mushroomed since M23 began its advance.

Rwanda has been accused by Congo, the United Nations and Western countries of supporting M23 with its own troops and weapons, a charge Kigali denies.

At least 3,000 people have been killed and hundreds of thousands displaced by the recent fighting.

1556443,Siemens shareholders reject proposal to allow virtual AGMs,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Siemens' board lost its attempt on Thursday to allow the company to continue to hold virtual AGMs in future without the physical presence of investors.

Some 71% of shareholders approved the change to the company's rules, which would allow virtual AGMs to be held for the next two years, missing the 75% needed.

The move had been criticised by some shareholders, who said it prevented them showing their support or opposition to company's proposals or speaking with each other.

Chairman Jim Hagemann Snabe said he regretted the outcome, especially as most shareholders had voted for online AGMs, which Siemens has held since 2021, to continue.

Snabe was re-elected to the company's board for another two years, despite some shareholders raising concerns about his long stint at the top of the German technology and engineering company.

Deka Investments, which owns a 0.79% stake in Siemens and is the 11th biggest shareholder, said Snabe, who has been a member of the Siemens supervisory board since 2013 and chairman since 2018, could no longer be seen as independent because of his long spell in office.

Former Nestle and Fresenius CEO Mark Schneider was also elected to Siemens' supervisory board on Thursday. Siemens has previously mentioned Schneider as a potential successor to Snabe.

The maker of the blockbuster franchise ""Assassin's Creed"" reported net bookings of 301.8 million euros ($314.69 million) for the three months ending December 31, in line with its revised guidance of about 300 million euros.

It confirmed its financial targets and expects net bookings of around 1.9 billion euros and about break-even non-IFRS operating income and free cash flow for FY2024-25. Fourth quarter net bookings are expected to grow year-on-year thanks to the ""Assassin’s Creed Shadows"" release.

Ubisoft is now focusing on the launch of the newest instalment of the ""Assassin's Creed"" franchise set for March 20. ""Assassin's Creed Shadows"" is an action-adventure game, set in feudal Japan, in which players follow the stories of a shinobi assassin (Naoe) and a samurai (Yasuke).

""Early previews have been positive, praising its narrative and immersive experience, with both characters playing critical roles in the game’s storyline, as well as the quality and complementarity of the gameplay provided by the dual protagonist approach"", CEO Yves Guillemot said in a statement.

Ubisoft said that pre-orders for the game are ""tracking solidly"", in line with those of ""Assassin’s Creed Odyssey"", the second most successful entry of the franchise.

The company now expects to exceed 200 million euros in fixed cost reductions by FY2024-25 versus FY2022-23, ahead of schedule, and plans to pursue these efforts in FY26.

Ubisoft said that the review of strategic options is ongoing and an ad-hoc independent board committee will oversee the process to extract the best value from Ubisoft’s assets and franchises for all stakeholders.

1556599,"Arm secures Meta as first customer for ambitious new chip project, FT reports","(Reuters) -Arm Holdings plans to launch its own chip this year after securing Meta Platforms as one of its first customers, in a major shift to the chip tech provider's model of licensing its blueprints to other companies, the Financial Times reported on Thursday, sending its U.S.-listed shares up about 5%.

This move would put Arm in direct competition with some of its largest customers, including Nvidia, which build their own chips on top of Arm's architecture.

Arm has been somewhat exempt from the AI-linked growth spurts enjoyed by chipmakers because it makes money from AI indirectly by steadily raising licensing fees for its technology and charging royalties for each chip other companies sell.

Rene Haas, Arm CEO, will unveil the first chip that it has made in-house as early as this summer, the FT reported, citing people familiar with the company's plans.

Arm's chip is expected to be a central processing unit (CPU) for servers in large data centres and is built on a base which can then be customised for clients including Meta, the report said.

Production will be outsourced to a manufacturer such as TSMC, according to the report.

SoftBank and Meta did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment while Arm declined to comment.

Masayoshi Son, founder of Arm's majority owner SoftBank, has placed Arm at the centre of his push to expand AI infrastructure, with the launch of Arm's own chip considered a step in his larger plans to move into AI chip production, FT reported.

SoftBank is also nearing a $6.5 billion buyout of Oracle-backed chip designer Ampere, a deal considered essential to Arm's own chipmaking project, according to the report.

The surge in political ad spending and the launch of streaming channels like Peacock, Disney+ and HBO Max have boosted Roku's subscriber base, ad revenue and overall growth.

""We continue to make progress growing ad demand through deeper third-party platform integrations, improving the Roku Experience (which starts at our Home Screen) to expand monetization, and growing Roku-billed subscriptions,"" the company said in a letter to shareholders.

Roku has expanded its advertising offerings to small- and medium-sized businesses, leveraging its home screen to diversify revenue streams across sectors.

Brands from retail, automotive and telecom now feature their ads in the platform, enhancing visibility and boosting user engagement. This move allows businesses to tap into Roku's extensive user base.

The company's platform segment, which derives revenue from ad sales and subscriptions, grew 25% to $1.04 billion due to advertising activities, particularly from the political vertical.

Ahead of the results, Barton Crockett from Rosenblatt said: ""Political advertising on connected TV (CTV) stepped up meaningfully this cycle versus the last cycle, in part because of a big push into the medium by Kamala Harris.""

The company reported revenue of $1.20 billion in the fourth quarter, compared to the analysts' average estimate of $1.15 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.

For the full year, Roku expects net revenue of $4.61 billion, compared to analysts' consensus estimate of $4.59 billion.

It expects revenue of $1.01 billion for the first quarter, which is in line with estimates.

""Malaysia is the only official foreign actor that takes part as a facilitator of the peace dialogue process, supporting Thailand in restoring peace and security, as well as developing the region with a sustainable approach, in the interests of the people of both countries.

Moody’s described the uptrend as a “rapid surge,” adding that isolation during the pandemic had triggered a spike in financial grooming scams targeting vulnerable people with greater need for emotional connection like senior citizens.

Moody’s said the number of Malaysian entities and people with potential links to love scams also rose to 62 last year from just six in 2023. That accounted for five per cent of the total count.

Overall, the Philippines and Malaysia were among the top 10 countries in terms of number of dubious profiles last year, with the United States leading with a 38 per cent share.

Completing the list were Nigeria (14 per cent), India (12 per cent), the United Kingdom (11 per cent), China (5 per cent), Brazil (4 per cent), Canada (4 per cent) and Australia (3 per cent).

“Criminals often seek to launder the money generated from romance scams like sextortion via the traditional financial system. Banks can face significant reputational risks and fines,” Moody’s said.

Sabah Immigration Department Datuk Sitti Saleha Habib Yussof said of these 76 people, 48 were men, 11 women, 12 boys and five girls.

All are aged between three-months and 76, she said in a statement late Thursday (Feb 13).

She said children involved in this deportation on Wednesday (Feb 12) are with their parents or guardians.

Sitti said these immigrants were taken from the Sandakan Immigration Depot to the Lahad Datu Customs, Immigration, Quarantine and Security (ICQS) office, to Tawi-Tawi Philippines on a ferry.

All these deported paid for their own expenses home, she said, adding that all of them have served sentences under various immigration offences including overstaying and illegal entry.

As per usual procedure, all deported immigrants will be blacklisted from entering Sabah, she said.

Sitti said to date, the state has sent home a total of 437 immigrants, out of which the Filipinos make the most number of deportees at 221 people, followed by Indonesians (165), Pakistanis (33), China nationals (12), three Vietnamese and three other nationals.

For Filipino immigrants, deportations are based on the issuance of travel documents from the Philippines embassy in Malaysia.

She said this programme is to also reduce congestion in immigration depots and to cut short the detention period.

“The Sabah Immigration Department will not compromise on anyone breaking immigration rules, not on the immigrants themselves, employers or employees,” said Sitti.

At 8 am, the ringgit surged to 4.4325/4555 versus the US dollar versus Thursday’s close of 4.4535/4600.

Bank Muamalat Malaysia Bhd chief economist Dr Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid said Malaysia’s fourth-quarter (4Q) growth is expected at 4.8 per cent and full-year 2024 growth is projected at 5.1 per cent, suggesting that the economy has been growing at a decent rate last year.

""Perhaps, this would motivate the central bank to keep the overnight policy rate steady at 3.00 per cent, which would support the ringgit, given that its counterparts in ASEAN have begun to ease its monetary policies,” he told Bernama.

Meanwhile, Mohd Afzanizam said the US Dollar Index (DXY) fell 0.58 per cent to 107.313 points while equities and bond markets rally also bolstered the ringgit.

The ringgit is poised to have a good start today, and possibly attempt to pierce its immediate support level of RM4.45, he said.

Meanwhile, the ringgit traded lower against a basket of major currencies but appreciated versus the euro to 4.6373/6613 from 4.6419/6487 at Thursday’s close.

1556417,Initiative bolsters S’pore’s medical technology sector,"SINGAPORE: To help boost Singapore’s medical technology sector, a newly launched initiative will connect medtech companies with local partners to innovate and scale up production.

MedTech Catapult, a S$38mil national initiative hosted by the Agency for Science, Technology and Research or A*Star, aims to speed up the development and commercialisation of life science instruments and medical devices.

Its goal is to connect product owners with contract manufacturers, identify high-value project ideas and translate these ideas into commercial products.

MedTech Catapult officially launched at the Biopolis biomedical research and development centre on Wednesday, but has been operating since April 2024.

In MedTech Catapult’s first year, it has supported projects such as a 4D-printed remouldable short arm cast for wrist fractures by Castomize, a spin-off from the Singapore University of Technology and Design that develops remouldable casts used to support injured bones.

So-called 4D-printing combines 3D-printing technology with smart materials that can change shapes or properties over time in response to external stimuli, like heat, light and moisture.

MedTech Catapult also supported a kidney-stone treatment where patient outcomes are enhanced via an intelligent system that was developed by Dornier MedTech, in partnership with A*Star and Ng Teng Fong General Hospital.

The system supports laser lithotripsy, a procedure that uses a laser to break up stones in the urinary tract.

In Asia alone, the medtech sector is projected to grow from US$164bil today to over US$225bil in 2030, according to the Economic Development Board’s or EDB estimates.

The Australia captain on Tuesday was found not guilty of racially abusing a British police officer after a dispute with a cab driver two years ago.

Kerr, who called the police officer ""stupid and white"", apologised in a statement for ""expressing (herself) poorly"" after she was acquitted by a jury at Kingston Crown Court.

Chelsea boss Bompastor said the apology was enough.

""She made a statement, she was clear in her statement, and I think that's enough,"" Frenchwoman Bompastor told reporters.

""What she was facing last week was hard enough for her, so the only thing we want to do as a club is support her.""

Though cleared by the court, Australia's football association has faced calls to strip Kerr of the captaincy of the Matildas because of her conduct during the incident.

Football Australia (FA) was unaware of Kerr's legal trouble for over a year until media reported her entering a not-guilty plea to the racial charge last March.

FA said in a statement it looked forward to Kerr returning to the pitch from injury but would ""reflect"" with her on learnings from the incident.

Kerr, Australia's all-time top scorer with 69 goals, has been sidelined for over a year following knee surgery but is back training with Chelsea.

Bompastor did not give a timeline for Kerr's return to action but said her recovery was progressing well.

The 27-year-old Latvian's relentless pace and aggressive ball-striking proved too much for the Tunisian. Ostapenko will meet three-times defending champion Iga Swiatek in Friday's semi-final, after Swiatek's 6-2, 7-5 win over Elena Rybakina on Thursday.

Ostapenko said the hostile crowd fuelled her motivation as she avenged her first-round loss to Jabeur at the Abu Dhabi Open last week, firing four aces and breaking her opponent five times while Jabeur managed just one break in the opening set.

""I know Ons is their favourite, I respect that, but, you know, between serves, shouting and whistling and coughing, I think it's a little bit disrespectful, not only to me, if this happens to any other player I think they should be taken care of,"" Ostapenko said in the post-match press conference.

""I respect Ons, I respect the crowd, and I feel like some moments they were even motivating me better, like more and more, and I was playing even better, so I kind of like it, you know.""

Addressing the crowd on court after her win she said: ""It’s great that Ons is playing like a woman from Middle East and she is representing. Its amazing what she has done for tennis but you guys made me angry and more motivated.""

Ostapenko leads 4-0 in her head-to-head record against Swiatek, having last beaten her in the fourth round of the U.S. Open in 2023 and has been in top form in Doha, defeating fourth seed Jasmine Paolini 6-2 6-2 before her win over Jabeur.

Holders Pakistan will host an ICC showpiece event for the first time in 28 years. The eight-team quadrennial One-Day International (ODI) tournament kicks off on Feb. 19 in Karachi and the final will be held on March 9.

There will be 15 matches across Pakistan and Dubai, after India refused to travel to rivals Pakistan, instead agreeing to play their matches in the neutral Gulf city.

The runners-up will get $1.12 million, and the losing semi-finalists will be awarded $560,000 each. Teams that finished fifth or sixth will each earn $350,000 while the seventh and eighth-placed sides take home $140,000.

The 2021 edition of the Champions Trophy was scrapped by the ICC in 2016, which wanted only one major tournament in each of the sport's three international formats, prioritising the 50-over World Cup. The decision was reversed in late 2021.

The 2023 edition of the quadrennial 10-team ODI World Cup, won by Australia after they beat India in Gujarat, featured a larger number of group-stage and knockout matches and offered a $4 million prize for the winning team from a pot of $10 million.

Bayern beat Celtic 2-1 in Glasgow on Wednesday in the first leg of their Champions League playoff for a spot in the Round of 16. The second leg on Tuesday is just three days after their game at Leverkusen.

Leverkusen will be somewhat fresher, having not needed a Champions League playoff after qualifying automatically for the Round of 16 with a top-eight finish in the league phase.

""The game is of interest to a lot of people. You have to remember that in the last 18 months they only lost once in the league. That shows how well they're working. We want to be one of the teams that win there,"" he said.

Leverkusen won last season's league and German Cup double without a single defeat. So far they have lost one game this season in the Bundesliga.
