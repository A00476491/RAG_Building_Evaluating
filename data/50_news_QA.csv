The devotees celebrated the festival in temples by pouring water or milk over the Shiva linga, a stone sculpture symbolic of Shiva, the Hindu god of destruction.

Some also observed a fast during the day and stayed up all night, singing and dancing to religious songs.

At some temples, Hindu holy men, also known as Sadhus, smoked marijuana – a practice that is normally illegal but is permitted during the Shivaratri festival – and smeared their bodies with ash in devotion.

The festival was also celebrated in neighbouring Nepal’s Pashupati temple, and many Indian Hindus, who make up 80% of the country’s 1.4 billion people, travelled there for the festival.

This year’s festival coincided with the last day of the Maha Kumbh festival that’s held every 12 years.

This year, the festival started on Jan 13, with more than 500 million people attending so far.

At least 30 people were killed in a stampede at the festival last month, after tens of millions of Hindus gathered to take a dip in sacred river waters.

According to the Palawan Police Provincial Office, the fishermen were fishing about 26 miles off Calandagan near Canaron Island, using hook and line, when they caught a 20-kilogramme shark.

Upon returning to shore, the fishermen slaughtered the shark to sell it to waiting residents. During the process, a human arm measuring approximately 30 cm (12 inches) fell out of the shark’s stomach.

The fishermen immediately buried the severed arm and reported the incident to authorities.

On Feb 17, personnel from the Araceli Municipal Police Station and the Municipal Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office went to the barangay to retrieve the arm for fingerprinting and possible identification. However, the arm was too decomposed to obtain fingerprints.

Meanwhile, the Sangguniang Barangay of Calandagan released an official statement explaining that they did not publicly disclose the incident to avoid confusion and to allow authorities to handle the situation appropriately.

Barangay officials also said they investigated and interviewed the fishermen involved and subsequently turned the matter over to higher authorities for further examination. - Philippine Daily Inquirer/ANN",AseanPlus,Philippines,Complimentary,Short,,2025-02-28,"Philippines,Palawan,shark,arm,fishermen","Fishermen from Barangay Calandagan in Araceli town, Palawan province found a human arm inside the stomach of a shark they caught recently, police said on Thursday (Feb 27).",https://www.thestar.com.my/aseanplus/aseanplus-news/2025/02/28/fishermen-in-palawan-find-human-arm-inside-sharks-belly,https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/02/28/3190328.jpg,206,"What did fishermen from Barangay Calandagan in Araceli town, Palawan province find inside the stomach of the shark they caught?","Fishermen from Barangay Calandagan in Araceli town, Palawan province found a human arm inside the stomach of a shark they caught recently, police said on Thursday (Feb 27)."

1567897,"Bukit Aman wants to introduce updated conduct, discipline regulations for the force","MELAKA: The police hope to introduce the Police Regulations (Conduct and Discipline) 2024 to expedite the process of dismissing problematic officers and also to enhance public confidence in the force.

Bukit Aman's Integrity and Standards Compliance Department (JIPS) Director, Comm Datuk Seri Azri Ahmad said the proposed new regulations also aim to replace the Public Officers (Conduct and Discipline) Regulations 1993 (PPPA (K&T) 1993), which are considered too general and less suitable for the police.

He said that the suspension procedures under PPPA (K&T) 1993 are not aligned with the specific needs of the force, as the police requires stricter operational and disciplinary measures.

“The police are entrusted with significant authority, so if a police officer is deemed unfit to serve, they must be removed immediately,"" he said on Friday (Feb 28).

Comm Azri noted that the existing dismissal process under PPPA (K&T) 1993 is lengthy and inefficient.

""Therefore, there should be specific police regulations that allow immediate action.

“We need to swiftly remove those who tarnish our force. This move is not intended to victimise anyone, but it is necessary because public expectations of the police are very high,” he said.

Earlier, Comm Azri witnessed the handing-over of duties ceremony where acting Melaka police chief Senior Asst Comm Datuk Md Nazri Zawawi officially transferred his duties to incoming state police chief, Deputy Comm Datuk Dzulkhairi Mukhtar.

Comm Azri added that with the introduction of new regulations, managing disciplinary proceedings will become more efficient and effective without delays while upholding the principles of natural justice.

""Disciplinary actions, especially those involving dismissal or demotion, can be carried out more swiftly and systematically.

1567334,Tourists step into N. Korea after five-year freeze,"A small group of foreign tourists has visited North Korea in the past week, making them the first international travellers to enter the country in five years except for a group of Russian tourists who went to the North last year.

The latest trip indicates North Korea may be gearing up for a full resumption of its international tourism to bring in much-needed foreign currency to revive its struggling economy, experts say.

The Beijing-based travel company Koryo Tours said it arranged a five-day trip from Feb 20 to Feb 24 for 13 international tourists to the northeastern North Korean border city of Rason, where the country’s special economic zone is located.

Koryo Tours general manager Simon Cockerell said the travellers from the United Kingdom, Canada, Greece, New Zealand, France, Germany, Austria, Australia and Italy crossed by land from China.

He said that in Rason, they visited factories, shops, schools and the statues of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il, the late grandfather and father of current leader Kim Jong-un.

“Since January of 2020, the country has been closed to all tourists, and we are glad to have finally found an opening in the Rason area, in the far north of North Korea,” Cockerell said.

“Our first tour has been and gone, and now more tourists on both group and private visits are going in, arranging trips.”

After the pandemic began, North Korea quickly banned tourists, jetted out diplomats and severely curtailed border traffic in one of the world’s most draconian Covid-19 restrictions.

But since 2022, North Korea has been slowly easing curbs and reopening its borders.

In February 2024, North Korea accepted about 100 Russian tourists, the first foreign nationals to visit the country for sightseeing. — AP",AseanPlus,North Korea,Complimentary,Short,,2025-02-28,"North Korea,foreign tourists","A small group of foreign tourists has visited North Korea in the past week, making them the first international travellers to enter the country in five years except for a group of Russian tourists who went to the North last year.",https://www.thestar.com.my/aseanplus/aseanplus-news/2025/02/28/tourists-step-into-n-korea-after-five-year-freeze,https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/02/28/3189478.jpg,287,What activities did the group of 13 international tourists do during their trip to Rason in North Korea?,"The group of 13 international tourists did the following activities during their trip to Rason in North Korea:
