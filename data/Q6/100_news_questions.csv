The latest trip indicates North Korea may be gearing up for a full resumption of its international tourism to bring in much-needed foreign currency to revive its struggling economy, experts say.

The Beijing-based travel company Koryo Tours said it arranged a five-day trip from Feb 20 to Feb 24 for 13 international tourists to the northeastern North Korean border city of Rason, where the country’s special economic zone is located.

Koryo Tours general manager Simon Cockerell said the travellers from the United Kingdom, Canada, Greece, New Zealand, France, Germany, Austria, Australia and Italy crossed by land from China.

He said that in Rason, they visited factories, shops, schools and the statues of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il, the late grandfather and father of current leader Kim Jong-un.

“Since January of 2020, the country has been closed to all tourists, and we are glad to have finally found an opening in the Rason area, in the far north of North Korea,” Cockerell said.

“Our first tour has been and gone, and now more tourists on both group and private visits are going in, arranging trips.”

After the pandemic began, North Korea quickly banned tourists, jetted out diplomats and severely curtailed border traffic in one of the world’s most draconian Covid-19 restrictions.

But since 2022, North Korea has been slowly easing curbs and reopening its borders.

Uchida, 58, told reporters earlier this month that while he was prepared to relinquish his position if asked, he didn’t want to step down before steadying Nissan’s business.

Caro Quintero, a co-founder of the Guadalajara Cartel, one of Latin America's most powerful drug trafficking organizations during the 1980s, spent 28 years in prison for the brutal murder and torture of former U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent Enrique ""Kiki"" Camarena, one of the most notorious killings in Mexico's bloody narco wars.

Caro Quintero has previously denied involvement in the killing of Camarena. He was released in 2013 on a technicality by a Mexican judge and returned to trafficking before he was eventually captured by Mexican authorities in 2022.

Mexico on Thursday also extradited Miguel Angel Trevino Morales, known as Z-40, and Oscar Omar Trevino Morales, known as Z-42, two suspected former leaders of the violent Los Zetas drug cartel to the United States, the Webb County Sheriff's Office in Texas said.

There was no immediate reaction from Kyiv to the allegation.

Shevkunov, who has been described in Russian media reports for years as ""Putin's confessor"" - something he has neither confirmed nor denied - has maintained a public acquaintance with President Vladimir Putin since the late 1990s and the Kremlin has said the two men know each other well.

In 2023, he was appointed metropolitan of Crimea, becoming one of the top Russian Orthodox Church officials on the peninsula, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014.

The FSB said in a statement it had detained one Russian and one Ukrainian man in connection with the plot and had confiscated an improvised explosive device. It said the two suspects, whom it did not name, had confessed.

It said that the two men, who it said had been recruited by Ukraine using the Telegram messenger service, had been plotting the assassination attempt since mid 2024 and had planned to kill Shevkunov in Moscow.

Ukraine has taken responsibility for a number of assassinations in Russia since the start of the war in 2022, including pro-Moscow Ukrainian blogger Vladlen Tatarsky in April 2023, and the head of Russia's Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection Troops, Igor Kirillov, in December 2024.

Francis, 88, was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on February 14 with what was originally described as a bronchitis and was later revealed to have developed into something more serious.

In a medical update on Thursday, the Vatican said the pontiff's condition had ""continued to show improvement"" but his prognosis remained guarded due to a complex clinical picture.

A Vatican official, who did not wish to be named because he was not authorised to discuss the pope's health, noted that Thursday's statement was the second consecutive one that did not describe the pope's condition as ""critical"".

""Maybe we can say he has passed the most critical phase,"" said the official.

Cardinal Michael Czerny, head of the Vatican's human development office, said in an interview with Italy's La Stampa newspaper that Francis was getting better, albeit ""slower than what we would like"".

Francis, who has been pope since 2013, has suffered several bouts of ill health over the past two years. He is prone to lung infections because he developed pleurisy as a young adult and had part of one lung removed.

Double pneumonia is a serious infection of both lungs that can inflame and scar them, making it difficult to breathe. The Vatican said Francis suffered a ""prolonged asthma-like respiratory crisis"" on Saturday, but there have been no repeats.

The move undermines state institutions, touching off a constitutional crisis in ethnically polarised post-war Bosnia. Russia, Dodik's most powerful supporter, said the sentence was politically motivated and would destabilise the Balkans.

The court in Bosnia's capital Sarajevo acted after Dodik

signed Serb Republic legislation suspending rulings by Bosnia's constitutional court and international envoy Christian Schmidt, who oversees implementation of the 1995 Dayton peace treaty.

Dodik, in remarks to lawmakers before they approved the law on Thursday evening, cast the move as an act of secession in defiance of the 1990s peace accord that kept Bosnia intact but split into two autonomous regions largely along ceasefire lines.

""This moment is favourable and I call on you to vote for the law without hesitation,"" the Bosnian Serb nationalist leader told MPs in Banja Luka, the regional capital. ""We think this creates momentum for us to do this without the use of force.""

They are also unhappy about several non-functional parking payment machines there, which is causing great inconvenience.

Nadila Abd Rahim said that because of this, visitors tended to crowd at the remaining few machines still functional.

“The machines are also located far from each other, forcing us to walk some distance to pay for parking,” she said.

KC Chong, meanwhile, took issue with poor lighting at the underground facility, which she said posed a risk especially to women.

“Some parts of the carpark are very dark, which may encourage criminals to take advantage of the situation,” she said.

S. Ganesan said the parking facility reflected poorly on Kuala Lumpur and its readiness to welcome visitors ahead of the Visit Malaysia 2026 campaign.

Several parking payment machines at the carpark are non-functional.

“This is a tourism hotspot,” she said.

“What kind of impression are we giving to people who visit?”

Amir Hakim Abdullah found the cracked floors and spots of discolouration on the walls thoroughly unpleasant.

“The relevant authorities should undertake works to repair and spruce up the parking facility,” he said.

Adrian Wong, meanwhile, said stronger penalties were needed to deter vandals and litterbugs in the area.

“I have seen some people throwing used plastic wraps on the ground.

“We cannot always blame the authorities; the public should behave responsibly too,” he added.

According to a banner displayed on site, the carpark operates between 6am and 8pm on weekdays and around the clock on weekends.

Musk, the world's richest person and a senior adviser to President Donald Trump who is working on restructuring the federal government, owns the Starlink satellite system which is a rival to Verizon's. Verizon operates the largest U.S. wireless network.

""The Verizon communication system to air traffic control is breaking down very rapidly. The FAA assessment is single digit months to catastrophic failure, putting air traveler safety at serious risk,"" Musk, said in a post on social media platform X.

This week, the FAA said it was testing three Starlink terminals at a government facility in Alaska to address concerns about reliable weather information for the aviation community in that state.

""The FAA has been considering the use of Starlink since the prior administration to increase reliability at remote sites, including in Alaska,"" the FAA said this week. The agency did not immediately comment on Musk's tweet.

On Wednesday, the Washington Post reported that the FAA was close to canceling a $2.4 billion contract awarded to Verizon in 2023 to overhaul a communications system, and awarding the work to Musk's Starlink. The FAA said it has not made any decision on the contract.

Verizon did not immediately comment on Musk's remarks. The company said this week company it was at the beginning of a 15-year contract with the FAA ""that will help the agency modernize its technology. Protecting Americans who rely on a safe, secure and functioning air traffic control system is more important than ever, and our enhancements will help make that happen.""

The alternative asset manager has discussed providing a major part of the financing, according to the report.

Growing computational requirements of artificial intelligence systems have significantly increased the demand for data centers.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg had said in January the company would spend as much as $65 billion this year to expand its AI infrastructure.

The Facebook-parent did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while Apollo Global Management declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.

Meta also plans to invest $10 billion to set up an AI data center in Louisiana, it said in December.

The amount of electricity used by the Meta data center in Louisiana will be matched by renewable energy, for which the tech firm will be working with utility Entergy.

Last week, brokerage TD Cowen said Microsoft canceled leases totaling ""a couple of hundred megawatts"" of capacity with at least two private data-center operators.

It has stoked skepticism among investors due to slow payoffs and breakthroughs at Chinese startup DeepSeek, which showcased AI tech at a much lower cost than its Western rivals.

1567953,Lenovo wins appeal in UK fight with Ericsson over interim patent licence,"LONDON (Reuters) - Lenovo on Friday won an appeal in Britain in its attempt to get an interim licence to use Ericsson's patents, in the latest ruling in the companies' global licensing dispute over 5G wireless technology.

Lenovo sued Ericsson at London's High Court in 2023, one of several cases brought by Lenovo or Ericsson around the world which has seen the companies trade lawsuits in Brazil, Colombia and the United States.

The dispute centres on the fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms for a licence to use Lenovo and Ericsson's patents. Disputes over FRAND licensing have led to global legal battles in the telecom industry.

In London, Lenovo sought a declaration that a willing licensor would agree to a short-term licence pending the final determination of FRAND terms.

Its application was refused last year, but the Court of Appeal overturned that decision on Friday.

Judge Richard Arnold said in a written ruling that ""a willing licensor in the position of Ericsson would enter into an interim licence with Lenovo"", adding that he hoped Ericsson would now choose to do so.

Lenovo's Chief Legal Officer Laura Quatela said the ruling ""not only confirms that Lenovo is a willing licensee but strengthens and reaffirms our commitment to advocating for transparency and fairness in global FRAND licensing"".

Ericsson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The main suspect, a Danish national, ran an online platform where he distributed the AI-generated material he produced. Users around the world paid a ""symbolic online payment"" to access the platform.

The operation is ongoing, with authorities from 19 countries including Australia, Spain and the United Kingdom involved.

1567440,Apple accused of greenwashing in US lawsuit,"SAN FRANCISCO: A group of Apple Watch buyers have filed a lawsuit in Silicon Valley accusing the tech giant of exaggerating how environmentally friendly production of the smart wristwear is.

A civil suit filed Feb 26 argues that two nature-based projects Apple cites to back claims of carbon neutrality are areas where trees would be growing regardless of whether the tech company was involved.

""Apple's carbon neutrality claims are false and misleading because both projects fail to provide genuine, additional carbon reductions,"" the suit contends.

Apple, however, rejects the claims, telling AFP Thursday the company had ""drastically cut emissions for Apple Watch by over 75%, and we are investing significantly in nature-based projects to remove hundreds of thousands of metric tons of carbon from the air.""

The US tech giant claims to have retired 485,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents primarily through the Chyulu Hills Project in Kenya and the Guinan Project in China, according to the suit.

The Chyulu Hills Project purports to generate carbon credits by preventing deforestation but is on land that has been legally protected from deforestation since 1983, the suit maintains.

The Guinan Project claims to have planted trees on barren land but the area was already heavily forested before the project began, according to the suit.

Plaintiffs in the case are asking for class-action status to represent everyone who has bought the Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch Ultra 2, or the second-generation Apple Watch SE.

""Companies engage in greenwashing to capitalize on growing environmental consciousness while avoiding the costs and challenges of achieving genuine sustainability,"" the complaint argued.

GPT-4.5 comes with improved ability to recognize patterns, generate creative insights without reasoning and shows greater emotional intelligence, the company said.

Microsoft-backed OpenAI said it would begin rolling out GPT-4.5 to ChatGPT Plus and Team users next week, and then to Enterprise and Edu users the following week.

Vice President and first lady, Rosario Murillo, called the decision ""sovereign and irrevocable,"" stating Nicaragua would cease participation in all activities related to the Human Rights Council and its ""satellite mechanisms.""

The UN report, released on Wednesday, accuses Ortega and Murillo, who also serves as co-president, of having ""transformed the country into an authoritarian state where no independent institutions remain.""

The UN experts urged legal action against Nicaragua, highlighting human rights abuses in the Latin American country, which they said follow patterns that have been previously established as crimes against humanity.

Ortega's government in the past has ignored reports from the UN and the Organization of American States, which it says are part of an international campaign against it.

Murillo dismissed the UN report as ""falsehoods"" and ""slander.""

Nicaragua experienced mass anti-government protests in 2018 when Ortega's crackdown on dissent resulted in the death of over 350 people and sparked an international outcry over rights abuses.

""McLaren won the constructors' last year. We expect them to be one of the quickest, if not the quickest, as with Red Bull, who dominated for many, many years.

""For us, we're just trying to improve. I haven't even done the long run yet, so I'm about to do it this afternoon, and I'll get a bit of a better understanding of how this car behaves in a race stint.""

Hamilton, who moved from Mercedes at the end of last season, has so far done only short stints in the car.

The BBC and Sky Sports reported that Raducanu would be given extra security at Indian Wells, which runs from March 5-16.

Reuters has contacted organisers for comment.

Briton Raducanu looked distressed in her second-round match against Karolina Muchova in the Dubai Championships last week, and stood behind the umpire's chair while the man was led out by security personnel.

She eventually resumed the match and fought back from 4-0 down to force a tiebreak before losing 7-6(6) 6-4.

Dubai Police detained the man following Raducanu's complaint but the player later decided to drop the charges.

The governing body of women's tennis, the WTA, banned the man from all of its tournaments and said it would work with Raducanu and her team to ensure her well-being and provide any support needed.

Raducanu has struggled with form and fitness issues since her 2021 U.S. Open win and sits 55th in the rankings.

Since taking the helm from Steve Cooper in late November, Van Nistelrooy has won only two of 14 league matches and has now lost 11 of the last 12.

The former Netherlands striker netted 95 Premier League goals for Manchester United but his Leicester side have now gone four league games without scoring, conceding 12 in that time.

He cut a gloomy figure at the London Stadium watching a 2-0 lost to West Ham and the question now is whether he will still be on the touchline when they travel to Chelsea on March 9.

""What do you want me to say?,"" Van Nistelrooy replied when asked whether he expected to still be in charge. ""I keep working, I keep going.""

Leicester are 19th in the table, level with Ipswich but behind them on goal difference and five points adrift of 17th-placed Wolverhampton Wanderers.

""We know the situation we're in, we know the table,"" Van Nistelrooy said. ""We know how quick football can turn around.""

Leicester did muster more attacking intent in the second half which pleased their manager.

""I saw two different halves. I saw a first half where we tried not to lose, and another half where we tried to win,"" Van Nistelrooy said.

Their defence remains a glaring weakness, however, with only one clean sheet all season and 61 goals conceded.

The TFF fined the 62-year-old Portuguese 1,617,000 Turkish lira ($44,000) after he criticised the match officials in a press conference following the 0-0 Super Lig draw on Monday.

The penalties were due to ""derogatory and offensive statements towards the Turkish referee"" and accusations of chaos and disorder in Turkish football, the TFF said.

The TFF said Mourinho's remarks violated sports ethics, promoted violence and disorder and could incite fan incidents.

Monday's game was refereed by Slovenian Slavko Vincic after both clubs requested a foreign official take charge.

Fenerbahce issued a statement on Tuesday defending Mourinho, saying his comments were taken out of context and deliberately distorted.

Switching from singles to doubles is not uncommon and has proven successful for several Malaysian players.

Among them is M. Thinaah, who is thriving alongside Pearly Tan, and former men’s singles shuttler Goh Soon Huat, now ranked world No. 3 in mixed doubles with his wife, Shevon Lai Jemie.

Meanwhile, another Malaysian, K. Letshanaa, put up a strong fight against Denmark’s Line Christophersen but ultimately lost 22-20, 20-22, 15-21.

1567427,Soccer-Milan’s top-four hopes hit by 2-1 loss to Bologna,"BOLOGNA, Italy (Reuters) - AC Milan's Serie A top-four hopes were dealt a significant blow when they lost 2-1 at Bologna on Thursday after the hosts fought back from a goal down.

Milan are eighth in the standings with 41 points, eight behind Juventus in fourth with 12 rounds remaining. Bologna are sixth on 44.

It was the first time in nearly 23 years that Bologna had won a home match against Milan in Serie A. The match was originally scheduled for October but was called off due to flooding.

Two minutes before halftime, Rafael Leao pounced on a flick-on, breezed past his marker and rounded Bologna keeper Lukasz Skorupski to put Milan ahead.

Bologna equalised three minutes after the restart when a free kick into the box was headed down to Santiago Castro who finished from close range.

Milan protested, claiming the ball had ricocheted off Bologna's Giovanni Fabbian's arm before reaching Castro, but VAR allowed the goal to stand.

Yunus Musah nearly put Milan ahead again just after the hour mark, but Skorupski made a crucial save.

Bologna gradually took control of the match as Milan's defence appeared to lose focus, Nicolo Casale heading against the post from a corner before Nicolo Cambiaghi sent the rebound over the bar.

The turnaround was complete nine minutes from time when Nicolo Cambiaghi reached the byline and sent in a cross that Dan Ndoye, at full stretch, tapped into the net.

The American had just putted out on the par-four sixth hole when he spotted the alligator and sprung into action to help an empty-handed police officer who was attempting to shoo away the reptile.

""Listen, he was going nowhere good. So I just went over there, helped the cop. Before I went over there, he (Cameron Young) goes, 'What was he going to do, try and use a Taser on him?'"" Horschel told reporters.

Horschel grabbed the club from his bag and cautiously poked the alligator, prompting the course invader to swiftly turn around and retreat back into the water.

""Good thing I did grab a 60 because I've got two extra ones in the locker so if that one did become unavailable, I had two more in the locker,"" the 38-year-old Floridian said.

He finished the day with four birdies, an eagle and a bogey for a five-under par 66, and was seven shots back from the clubhouse lead.

1567409,Rugby-Ireland centre Ringrose to miss Six Nations clash with France after suspension,"(Reuters) - Ireland will be without Garry Ringrose for their crucial Six Nations clash with France after the centre's red card against Wales was upheld by a disciplinary committee on Thursday, but he should be available for the final game against Italy.

Ringrose received a yellow card, later upgraded to a 20-minute red on bunker review, for a dangerous tackle on Wales centre Ben Thomas that resulted in head-on-head contact, in Ireland's 27-18 win last Saturday.

The disciplinary committee determined that the mid-range entry point of six weeks/matches was appropriate, but after the player accepted committing an act of foul play, they applied the maximum 50% reduction.

That three week/game ban will be cut to two once Ringrose takes part in World Rugby’s Coaching Intervention Programme, which would make him available for Ireland's final Six Nations game against Italy.

Along with the France game on March 8, Ringrose will miss this weekend's United Rugby Championship game for Leinster against Cardiff.

Ireland lead the Six Nations standings after three wins from three and are still on course for the Grand Slam but with France three points behind in second, the French could still win the championship.

1567407,Juventus returns to first-half profit after Champions League return,"MILAN (Reuters) - Juventus on Thursday swung to a 17 million euro ($18 million) profit in the first half of its fiscal year, as the Italian soccer club's return to Europe's lucrative elite club competition Champions League boosted revenues.

The result compares with a loss of 95 million euros in the same period a year earlier. The company does not expect to post a net profit in the full year, despite a strong improvement at the operating level. Juventus' fiscal year runs from July 1 to June 30.

Operating revenue at the Turin-based club rose 29% to 224 million euros between July and December last year.

Juventus pocketed 69 million euros from Champions League's broadcasting rights and ticket sales, which helped it to offset in part the end of its front jersey sponsorship contract with auto brand Jeep, which is yet to be replaced by a new deal.

After dominating the Italian soccer landscape for nearly a decade until 2020, Juventus was hit by an accounting scandal linked to player trading and salary payments, whose consequences included a ban on European competitions in the 2023/2024 season.

Juventus, which has been controlled by the Agnelli family for a century, has beem forced to raise around 900 million euros in capital from its shareholders over the past six years.

Juventus expects to return to a full-year net profit in the 2026-2027 financial year, a decade after it last posted an an annual net profit.
